<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;1 (Jan. 28, 1915, ch. 20, &sect;1, 38 Stat. 800; July 11, 1941, ch. 290, &sect;&sect;5, 6(a), 55 Stat. 585).</p>
<p class="note-body">Said section has been divided. Provisions relating to operation under the Navy in time of war are placed in sections 3 and 4 of this title, and the remainder is in this section.</p>
<p class="note-body">This section continues the Coast Guard as a military service and branch of the armed forces of the United States at all times. By the act of July 11, 1941, 55 Stat. 585 (title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;1), the Coast Guard was constituted a branch of the land and naval forces of the United States at all times. This section therefore merely continues an existing agency and codifies existing law on the military status of the Coast Guard, substituting &quot;armed forces&quot; for &quot;land and naval forces&quot; because of the recent establishment of the Department of the Air Force as an &quot;armed force&quot; rather than as a part of the &quot;land and naval forces&quot;. The Coast Guard is designated a service in the Treasury Department except when operating as a service in the Navy. This is a better definition of the status of the Coast Guard than one which defines it as a service under the Treasury Department in time of peace, because the President is authorized to place the Coast Guard under the Navy in time of emergency, which could be in time of peace.</p>

<p class="note-body">This section contains a codification of functions. It sets forth in general language the primary responsibilities of the Coast Guard: enforcement of all Federal laws on waters to which they have application, safety of life and property at sea, aiding navigation, and readiness to function with the Navy. Having been created in 1915 by the consolidation of the Revenue Cutter Service and the Life Saving Service, the Coast Guard has gradually been given additional duties and responsibilities, such as the assignment of law enforcement powers on the high seas and navigable waters in 1936, the transfer of the Lighthouse Service in 1939, and the transfer of the Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation in 1942. Existing along with these other duties has been that of maintaining a state of readiness as a specialized service prepared for active participation with the Navy in time of war. These various interdependent functions of the Service have not been expressed collectively in any statute heretofore, but it is believed desirable to do so in this revision in order to have outlined in general terms in one section the broad scope of the functions of the Coast Guard. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.</p>

<p class="note-body">This section is new and provides that any law removing for the duration of a war or national emergency any restriction contained in any then-existing law as applied to the Navy shall operate in the same manner to remove such restrictions as applied to the Coast Guard. Included are restrictions relating to the manner in which purchases may be made and contracts awarded, fiscal operations, and personnel. This provision is designed to enable the Coast Guard to operate as efficiently as the Navy Department in time of war or during a national emergency and would permit the Coast Guard more effectively to maintain itself in a state of military readiness during periods of emergency. Since the Coast Guard operates as part of the Navy in time of war, it is essential that its operations be as flexible and as efficient as those of the Department of which it is to be a part. This section would prevent inadvertent failures specifically to mention the Coast Guard in legislation of the type described in this section from hindering service operations. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.</p>

<p class="note-body">Said sections have been divided. The provisions of the proviso of title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;11a, and the first proviso of title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;12, are placed in section 48 of this title and the remainder is placed in this section.</p>
<p class="note-body">The provisions regarding appointment of the Assistant Commandant and Engineer in Chief are coordinated, inasmuch as these positions are about equal in the Coast Guard organization. The qualification that the Engineer in Chief be appointed from the active list of engineering officers is changed to the active list of officers who have qualified for engineering duty, because there is no longer any provision for a corps of engineering officers. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">This section grants broad general powers concerning policy matters to the Secretary. Many of the powers are contained in existing law but some are enlarged and some additional powers are added as explained following.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (a) is based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;95 (Aug. 29, 1916, ch. 417, 39 Stat. 601). Said section has been divided. The provision authorizing the Secretary to man stations seems more appropriately given to the operational head of the Service, the Commandant, and for that reason is incorporated in section 93(c) of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (b) is based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;&sect;28, 42 (Aug. 16, 1916, ch. 417, 39 Stat. 601; July 3, 1926, ch. 742, &sect;11, 44 Stat. 817). These sections were rewritten in order to broaden existing authority in regard to the training of Coast Guard personnel at schools of the other armed forces, thus approaching a practice of war time, and making for economy in the training of Service personnel; such training would be on a basis mutually satisfactory to the Secretaries involved.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (c) is based on R.S. 4242 and on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;&sect;29, 93, 94, 98a (R.S. 4245, 4249; May 4, 1882, ch. 117, &sect;2, 22 Stat. 56; Aug. 29, 1916, ch. 417, 39 Stat. 601; June 6, 1940, ch. 257, &sect;4, 54 Stat. 247; Aug. 6, 1947, ch. 502, 61 Stat. 786). This subsection broadens existing law in that it provides general legislative authority for the construction and disposal of shore establishments of all types including aviation stations.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (d) is based in part on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;&sect;55, 57, 69, 109, and in part on title 31, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;&sect;487, 720, (R.S. 2748, 3618, 3692; June 18, 1878, ch. 265, &sect;3, 20 Stat. 163; Aug. 29, 1916, ch. 417, 39 Stat. 601). This subsection broadens existing law in that it provides general legislative authority for the design, construction, acquisition by other means, and disposal of vessels.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (e) is new. It is derived from title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;31b (June 6, 1941, ch. 177, 55 Stat. 247 [which was originally repealed by act June 30, 1949, ch. 288, title VI, &sect;602(a)(28), 63 Stat. 399, renumbered Sept. 5, 1950, ch. 849, &sect;6(a), (b), 64 Stat. 583]) which provides for the exchange of vehicles, planes, and engines; similar authority in relation to vessels, is granted to the Secretary by this subsection and should prove advantageous to the Government.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (f) is based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;96 and on title 33, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;&sect;729, 730, 731 (Mar. 3, 1875, ch. 130, &sect;1, 18 Stat. 372; Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 299, 35 Stat. 972; June 17, 1910, ch. 301, &sect;9, 36 Stat. 538; Mar. 4, 1913, ch. 168, 37 Stat. 1018). This subsection broadens the power of the Secretary to receive as a gift or purchase sites for stations, to include the acquisition of land by any means provided it is for the purpose of executing duties and functions of the Coast Guard.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (g) is based in part on title 33, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;732 (Aug. 28, 1916, ch. 414, &sect;2, 39 Stat. 538; July 11, <!-- PDFPage:31 -->1941, ch. 290, &sect;1, 55 Stat. 584) and grants authority to the Secretary to exchange interests in land as payment or part payment for other interests in land for the purpose of executing the duties and functions of the Coast Guard; this authority, on the basis of past experience, will prove advantageous to the Government.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (h) is new and merely insures that the Secretary may exercise any of the powers granted to the Commandant in this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (i) is based in part on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;&sect;51, 131 (R.S. 2756, 2758) and insures that the Secretary may do anything necessary to carry out the purposes of this title.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">This section grants powers to the Commandant concerning, in general, operations within the Service and the internal functioning of the Service. Many of the powers are contained in existing law, but some are enlarged, and some additional powers are added as explained following.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (a) is derived from title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;53, and title 34, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;471 (R.S. 1536). The authority to order vessels to cruise along the coasts should be in the operational head of the Service, and not in the President. This section is changed to cover adequately the necessary present day cruising and patrolling.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (b) is derived from R.S. 4242 and title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;&sect;29, 93, 94, 95, 97, 98a (R.S. 4245, 4249; May 4, 1882, ch. 117, &sect;&sect;2, 3, 22 Stat. 56; Aug. 29, 1916, ch. 417, 39 Stat. 601; Aug. 6, 1947, ch. 502, 61 Stat. 786; June 6, 1940, ch. 257, &sect;4, 54 Stat. 247), and specifically grants to the Commandant authority in regard to the establishment, discontinuance, and change of Coast Guard shore establishments other than Coast Guard districts. This power must exist inherently in order for the Service to function efficiently.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (c) is derived from title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;&sect;54, 97, 112 (May 4, 1882, ch. 117, &sect;3, 22 Stat. 56; May 30, 1908, ch. 231, 35 Stat. 553; Apr. 21, 1910, ch. 182, &sect;2, 36 Stat. 326), and specifically grants to the Commandant authority in regard to the assignment of vessels, vehicles, aids to navigation, and other equipment. This power is inherent to the proper functioning of any Service.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (d) is based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;91 (June 18, 1878, ch. 265, &sect;7, 20 Stat. 164; June 10, 1921, ch. 18, &sect;304, 42 Stat. 24; July 3, 1926, ch. 742, &sect;9, 44 Stat. 817). Said section has been divided. The part dealing with investigation of plans and inventions is covered in this subsection in broader terms, and the other parts are covered in general terms in section 632 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (e) is based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;111 (June 18, 1878, ch. 265, &sect;9, 20 Stat. 164). This section has been rewritten to broaden the authority to include any investigation or study that may be of assistance to the Coast Guard, the limitation as to investigation of shipwrecks having been eliminated.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (f) is new and is intended to give legislative recognition to the importance of disseminating information by the Coast Guard for the promotion of safety at sea, life-saving techniques, and other Coast Guard activities.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (g) is new and provides for the training of Coast Guard personnel at other than schools or institutions of the other armed forces. Such training is essential and has been carried on under the authority of appropriation acts for many years.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (h) is based in part on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;&sect;69, 108, 109, (R.S. 2748; June 20, 1874, ch. 344, &sect;9, 18 Stat. 127; June 18, 1878, ch. 265, &sect;3, 20 Stat. 163), and is intended to complement the authority granted to the Secretary in sec. 92(d) of this title granting similar authority to the Commandant as to smaller craft.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (i) is based in part on title 14, U.S.C., &sect;&sect;108, 109, and on title 33, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;752 (June 20, 1874, ch. 344, &sect;9, 18 Stat. 127; June 18, 1878, ch. 265, &sect;3, 20 Stat. 163; Mar. 4, 1913, ch. 168, 37 Stat. 10183, and grants power to the Commandant to acquire and dispose of various equipment and supplies. The authority with respect to the acceptance of such equipment as a gift is new.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (j) is new and grants power to the Commandant to operate and maintain shore establishments; previously such authority has been inferred from statutes providing for the establishment of shore stations; again such authority is inherent to the functioning of any Service, and this section will provide no greater authority than has been exercised in the past.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (k) is based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;31b (June 6, 1941, ch. 177, 55 Stat. 247 [which was originally repealed by act June 30, 1949, ch. 288, title VI, &sect;602(a)(28), 63 Stat. 399, renumbered Sept. 5, 1950, ch. 849, &sect;6(a), (b), 64 Stat. 583]). The primary authority is granted to the Commandant as well as to the Secretary inasmuch as such exchange seems to be an operational matter and the items which may be exchanged have been enlarged by the addition of aids to navigation, appliances, equipment, and supplies.</p>
<p class="note-body">Inasmuch as the act cited above applies to the Navy as well as the Coast Guard it is not scheduled for repeal but is being amended by section 13 of this act to eliminate reference to the Coast Guard.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (l) is new and is deemed desirable in order to give legislative authority for existing yards, and for the procurement of needed equipment and material in case such is not normally or economically obtainable from private contractors.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (m) is based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;&sect;110, 192 (June 20, 1874, ch. 344, &sect;6, 18 Stat. 127; June 18, 1878, ch. 265, &sect;10, 20 Stat. 165; July 3, 1926, ch. 742, &sect;9, 44 Stat. 817). The power to accept volunteer services is enlarged to include all services offered in time of emergency, to save life or protect property, and the restrictive provisions relating to lifeboat stations only have been eliminated.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (n) is new and grants authority to the Commandant to lease real property under the control of the Coast Guard, when not immediately needed in Coast Guard operations. Such authority will be advantageous to the Government, on the basis of past experience.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (o) is new and is supplementary to subsection (n) of this section. It grants further authority to the Commandant permitting him to grant minor interests in land which is under control of the Coast Guard. This will avoid the necessity of special acts of Congress in each of such instances.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (p) is new and is necessary to give proper authority for the maintenance of networks of wires and cables, in some cases over or along private property or public highways. These networks are in existence at the present time and are essential for the Service to carry out its functions.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (q) is new and is necessary in order to provide clear authority for the maintenance of radio stations which are essential to Coast Guard functions.</p>
<p class="note-body">Changes were made in phraseology. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.</p>

<p class="note-body">Based on title 5, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;41, and on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed. &sect;&sect;22, 58, 91, 99, 103 (R.S. 2749; June 18, 1878, ch. 265, &sect;&sect;7, 8, 22 Stat. 164; May 4, 1882, ch. 117, &sect;5, 22 Stat. 57; Mar. 4, 1907, ch. 2918, 34 Stat. 1309; Jan. 28, 1915, ch. 20, &sect;1, 38 Stat. 800; Aug. 29, 1916, ch. 417, 39 Stat. 601; June 10, 1921, ch. 18, &sect;304, 42 Stat. 23; July 3, 1926, ch. 742, &sect;9, 44 Stat. 817).</p>
<p class="note-body">Said section 91 has been divided. That part dealing with investigation of plans and inventions is covered in section 93(d) of this title. The remainder is covered in general terms. It has been rewritten in broad terms, making clear that the Commandant is granted the necessary authority to administer the Coast Guard under the Secretary, including authority to issue rules, orders, and instructions.</p>
<p class="note-body">This section is primarily a consolidation of existing functions rather than a codification of existing laws. It does not, for the most part, grant new authority to the Coast Guard as an organization. It merely clarifies the method by which Coast Guard functions shall be administered. Under existing statutes, functions relating to the Coast Guard have been conferred upon the President, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the Commandant, and sometimes upon the Secretary of the Treasury in times of peace and the Secretary of the Navy in times of war. This revision confers some functions directly upon the Coast Guard, and this section provides for the execution of those functions by the Commandant, the military head of the organization, thereby making for consistency and uniformity. The functions are to be executed &quot;subject to the general supervision of the Secretary&quot;. Title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;91 now grants authority to the Commandant to prescribe regulations; this is changed to the issuance of rules, orders, and instructions as the promulgation of regulations in a military organization is properly a function of the Secretary.</p>

<p class="note-body">Because of the numerous situations in which it is necessary for the Coast Guard to deal with foreign governments, particularly in the field of safety of life and property at sea, the Coast Guard and the State Department agree that a provision such as this is desirable.</p>
<p class="note-body">The international character of many Coast Guard functions makes it more and more necessary for the Service to be an initiating or participating agency in international collaboration. Examples of international meetings concerned with matters affecting the Coast Guard include those which dealt with the International Rules of the Road, international load lines, the International Code of Signals, safety at sea, and international telecommunications. It is highly desirable that there be a clear-cut legislative expression of Coast Guard cooperation with the State Department on proposed international conferences dealing with various phases of Coast Guard activities, such as aids to navigation, life-saving equipment, navigation and communication equipment other than radio communication, regulation of dangerous cargoes, international rules of the road, safety requirements and equipment of transoceanic aircraft and vessels, and safe manning standards and efficiency of personnel employed on transoceanic aircraft and vessels. Provisions for similar relationship between the Civil Aeronautical Board and the State Department appear in the act of June 23, 1938, as amended, 52 Stat. 984 (title 49, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;&sect;425(c), 602). 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.</p>

<p class="note-body">Derived from title 34, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;441a (May 19, 1926, ch. 334, 44 Stat. 565; May 14, 1935, ch. 109, 49 Stat. 218; Oct. 1, 1942, ch. 571, 56 Stat. 763; 1946 Proc. No. 2695, July 4, 1946, 11 F.R. 7517, 60 Stat. 1352).</p>
<p class="note-body">Experience has indicated that it will be advantageous for the Government to include the Coast Guard along with the other armed forces for the purpose of detailing personnel for service with foreign governments.</p>
<p class="note-body">It seems probable that the increased collaboration with foreign governments after the war and the vital nature of the Coast Guard's activities in relation to such collaboration will result in requests from time to time by foreign governments for assistance which the Coast Guard is in the best position to render. This section, which confers broad authority in the President to detail Coast Guard officers and enlisted men to assist foreign governments, is patterned after the act of October 1, 1942, 56 Stat. 763 (title 34, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;441&ndash;a), which authorizes the President to detail Army, Navy, and Marine Corps officers and men to certain foreign governments and, in times of war or national emergency, to any foreign government in the interests of national defense. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.</p>

<p class="note-body">Experience since the war has indicated the necessity for making provision for the assignment of Coast Guard officers to diplomatic missions in those foreign countries which are extensively engaged in maritime commerce with the United States. This is largely the result of duties in connection with inspection of merchant vessels.</p>
<p class="note-body">This section authorizes the designation, with the consent of the State Department, of Coast Guard officers to be officially attached to diplomatic missions of the United States. Although Coast Guard advice on Coast Guard matters is always available to our diplomatic missions, in those locations where such advice and information are frequently sought, it is felt that the most effective utilization of Coast Guard services would be achieved by having Coast Guard officers attached to such missions. Provision for customs officers to be attached to diplomatic missions is contained in the act of March 4, 1923, as amended, 42 Stat. 1453 (title 19, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;6). Before the transfer in 1939 of the Foreign Agriculture Service to the State Department, representatives of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics of the Department of Agriculture stationed abroad were agricultural attach&#233;s. Act of June 5, 1930, 46 Stat. 498 (title 7, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;542(a)). 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.</p>

<p class="note-body">This section closely parallels title 46, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;&sect;797, 798, which authorizes the Secretary of the Navy to negotiate amicable settlement of claims against the United States arising out of the operation of Naval vessels. It grants similar authority to the Secretary of the Treasury in relation to vessels in the Coast Guard service, and the limiting amount is reduced from $1,000,000 to $25,000. It is believed that this section will work to the benefit of the Government by reducing civil litigation and the number of claims which must presently be certified to Congress for appropriations in order to make settlement. It will greatly expedite the settlement of just claims and should result in a considerable overall savings to the Government. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>In General</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may prescribe regulations governing accounting for industrial work, including charges for overhead for civilian labor and for maintenance of industrial plant and equipment, performed at the Coast Guard Yard or such similar Coast Guard industrial establishments as he may designate. Any orders placed for such industrial work shall be covered by a transfer or advance of funds to cover the estimated cost thereof, and shall be credited to such accounts as may be necessary and established by the Secretary to carry out the provisions of this section. Accounts so established shall be available for materials, supplies, or equipment, and civilian labor, including overhead and maintenance, required in performing the work ordered. Upon completion of an order an adjustment will be made to make the amount transferred or advanced equal to the actual cost as computed in accordance with the accounting regulations prescribed by the Secretary or in accordance with subsection (b).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Incentive Contracts.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The parties to an order for industrial work to be performed by the Coast Guard Yard or a Coast Guard industrial establishment designated under subsection (a) may enter into an order or a cost-plus-incentive-fee order in accordance with this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) If such parties enter into such an order or a cost-plus-incentive-fee order, an agreed-upon amount of any adjustment described in subsection (a) may be distributed as an incentive to the wage-grade industrial employees who complete the order.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:85 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Before entering into such an order or cost-plus-incentive-fee order such parties must agree that the wage-grade employees of the Coast Guard Yard or Coast Guard industrial establishment will take action to improve the delivery schedule or technical performance agreed to in the order for industrial work to which such parties initially agreed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if the industrial workforce of the Coast Guard Yard or Coast Guard industrial establishment satisfies the performance target established in such an order or cost-plus-incentive-fee order&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the adjustment to be made pursuant to subsection (a) shall be reduced by an agreed-upon amount and distributed to such wage-grade industrial employees; and</p>

<p class="note-body">This section is intended to eliminate a very cumbersome and inefficient method of accounting for industrial jobs at the Coast Guard Yard and other shore establishments where industrial work may be undertaken. Under existing law several accounts must be kept current for each job in progress. Under this statute the working fund would be available for all types of expenditures in connection with a job and the breakdown into separate accounts could be done after the job is complete. The other armed forces have provisions of law which permit a working fund similar to the one provided by this section. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.</p>
