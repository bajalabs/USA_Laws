<p class="note-body">This section does not change the present method of administration of the Academy. It makes statutory what has been administrative regulation heretofore, and it is believed highly desirable to make the control of an institution of such national interest as the Academy the subject of a statute.</p>
<p class="note-body">This section is new. There is no provision in existing law which establishes the Academy and sets it up as an operating unit. Nor is there any provision which creates the office of Superintendent of the Academy, or prescribes his duties and functions. Heretofore this has been accomplished by regulations, and the laws which deal with the Academy assume its existence as a going institution and assume the existence of the Superintendent with certain defined functions and duties. This section continues the Academy as previously established, provides for the appointment of the Superintendent by the Commandant, and defines in general terms his functions. The Academy would thus be placed on a definite statutory basis, and the office of Superintendent would be a statutory position, but the present administration of the Academy would in no way be interfered with. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.</p>

The work load of an instructor varies greatly, and flexibility in administration of a faculty is therefore essential. The leave provided for civil service employees does not fit the needs of an instruction staff, and this has been a source of difficulty in the past.

<p class="note-body">Section 15c of title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., has been divided. The last sentence is incorporated in this section, while the other provisions are placed in section 189 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">The composition of the teaching staff at the Academy is changed materially on the recommendation of the Academic Board and the Advisory Committee. The scope of duty of members of the staff is enlarged to include whatever the Commandant prescribes.</p>
<p class="note-body">Title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;15b provides for five professors as heads or assistant heads of departments at the Academy. The Academic Board of the Academy and the Advisory Committee, after extensive study have recommended the change, as provided in this section, to three professors and twelve others on the permanent teaching staff, with designations to conform generally with the designations and grades of faculty members at other universities. The librarian is given faculty status because of the role of the library as the center of the modern university; this is in conformity with the practice of other higher educational institutions. It is believed that the increased number of permanent commissioned instructors is justified and desirable in view of the expansion of the Cadet Corps as the full effect of the return to a four-year course is felt. It is probable that, in the next few years, the number of cadets will approximate 450. The average number in the past two years has been about 300. This new set-up for the permanent commissioned teaching staff will permit desirable exchanges of professors with leading universities, and occasional sabbatical leaves in order to better the faculty generally. It is pointed out that this increase in permanent instructors does not increase the authorized number of officers in the Coast Guard, as they are all included in the limitation provided in section 42 of this title. If a teaching position at the Academy is not provided for permanently it will require the assignment of an additional regular officer, so it is apparent that the changes proposed in this section do not increase the size of the Service, or the expense, but represent a long-range plan to better the Academy as a leading educational institution within the present, recognized, standards for a proper university faculty. The last sentence retains the command status of the professors as provided in existing law but enlarges the field in which they may perform duty, in order to make it possible to give them interim assignments other than at the Academy, thus broadening their knowledge of the Service while still advantageously utilizing their services. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.</p>

<p class="note-body">Based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;15f (Apr. 16, 1937, ch. 107, &sect;5, 50 Stat. 67).</p>
<p class="note-body">The provision prohibiting the retirement of a professor because of physical disability with less than 15 years&apos; service is changed to have application only during the temporary appointment of a professor.</p>
<p class="note-body">This section provides for the retirement of associate professors, assistant professors, and commissioned instructors in addition to professors. It is believed that the provision of existing law requiring 15 years&apos; service before becoming eligible for retirement, discriminated against this group of officers as no other group was discriminated against, and should be eliminated. It was changed so that these officers would be ineligible for retirement during their probationary term only.</p>
<p class="note-body">Changes were made in phraseology. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2113. Eligibility of officers for consideration for promotion</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) An officer on the active duty promotion list becomes eligible for consideration for promotion to the next higher grade at the beginning of the promotion year in which he completes the following amount of service computed from his date of rank in the grade in which he is serving:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) two years in the grade of lieutenant (junior grade);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) three years in the grade of lieutenant;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) four years in the grade of lieutenant commander;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) four years in the grade of commander; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) three years in the grade of captain.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) For the purpose of this section, service in a grade includes all qualifying service in that grade or a higher grade, under either a temporary or permanent appointment. However, service in a grade under a temporary service appointment under section 2125 of this title is considered as service only in the grade that the officer concerned would have held had he not been so appointed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) No officer may become eligible for consideration for promotion until all officers of his grade senior to him are so eligible.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:129 --><p class="statutory-body">(d) Except when his name is on a list of selectees, each officer who becomes eligible for consideration for promotion to the next higher grade remains eligible so long as he&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) continues on active duty; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) is not promoted to that grade.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) An officer whose involuntary retirement or separation is deferred under section 2156 of this title is not eligible for consideration for promotion to the next higher grade during the period of that deferment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) The Secretary may waive subsection (a) to the extent necessary to allow officers described therein to have at least two opportunities for consideration for promotion to the next higher grade as officers below the promotion zone.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g)(1) Notwithstanding subsection (a), the Commandant may provide that an officer may, upon the officer's request and with the approval of the Commandant, be excluded from consideration by a selection board convened under section 2106.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commandant shall approve a request under paragraph (1) only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the basis for the request is to allow the officer to complete a broadening assignment, advanced education, another assignment of significant value to the Coast Guard, a career progression requirement delayed by the assignment or education, or a qualifying personal or professional circumstance, as determined by the Commandant;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the Commandant determines the exclusion from consideration is in the best interest of the Coast Guard; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the officer has not previously failed of selection for promotion to the grade for which the officer requests the exclusion from consideration.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Secretary may, whenever the needs of the service require, but not more often than annually, convene a board consisting of not less than six officers of the grade of rear admiral (lower half) or rear admiral to recommend for continuation on active duty officers on the active duty promotion list serving in the grade of captain, who during the promotion year in which the board meets will complete at least three years&apos; service in that grade and who have not been selected for promotion to the grade of rear admiral (lower half). Officers who are subject to retirement under section 2149 of this title during the promotion year in which the board meets shall not be considered by this board.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Whenever he convenes a board under this section, the Secretary shall establish a continuation zone. The zone shall consist of the most senior captains eligible for consideration for continuation on active duty who have not previously been placed in a continuation zone under this section. The Secretary shall, based upon the needs of the service, prescribe the number of captains to be included in the zone.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Based on the needs of the service the Secretary shall furnish the board with the number of officers that may be recommended for continuation on active duty. This number shall be no less than 50 percent of the number considered. The board shall select from the designated continuation zone, in the number directed by the Secretary, those officers who are, in the opinion of the board, best qualified for continuation on active duty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The provisions of sections 2108, 2109, 2115, and 2117 of this title relating to selection for promotion shall, to the extent that they are not inconsistent with the provisions of this section, apply to boards convened under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) The Secretary shall prescribe by regulation the detailed procedures whereby officers in a continuation zone will be selected for continuation on active duty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) A board convened under this section shall submit its report to the Secretary. If the board has acted contrary to law or regulation, the Secretary may return the report for proceedings in revision and resubmission to the Secretary. After his final review the Secretary shall submit the report of the board to the President for his approval. Except as required by the procedures of this section, the proceedings of the board shall not be disclosed to any individual who is not a member of the board.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) Each officer who is considered but not recommended for continuation on active duty under the provisions of this section shall, unless retired under some other provision of law, be retired on June 30 of the promotion year in which the report of the continuation board convened under this section is approved, or the last day of the month in which he completes twenty years of active service, whichever is later.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) Notwithstanding subsection (g) and section 2149 of this title, the Commandant may by annual action retain on active duty from promotion year to promotion year any officer who would otherwise be retired under subsection (g) or section 2149 of this title. An officer so retained, unless retired under some other provision of law, shall be retired on June 30 of that promotion year in which no action is taken to further retain the officer under this subsection.</p>

<p class="note-body">Section 35 of title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., has been divided. The provisions of the first sentence of subsection (a) are placed in this section. The proviso of subsection (a) is covered in section 367(b) of this title. Subsection (b) is placed in section 365 of this title. Subsections (c) and (d) are placed in section 367(a) of this title, except that part (3) of subsection (c) is covered by section 366 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 206 of title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., has been divided. That part dealing with special temporary enlistments is incorporated in this section. That part dealing with temporary appointments of warrant officers is placed in section 302 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Certain additional details concerning the two types of enlistments are added; these details were previously covered in Coast Guard Regulations.</p>
<p class="note-body">This section makes provision for the enlistment of personnel in the Coast Guard. The first sentence grants the necessary authority to the Secretary, changes existing law in regard to the term of enlistment from &quot;not to exceed four years&quot; to &quot;not to exceed six years&quot;, and adds a provision for the enlistment of minors for their minority only, such provision being in accordance with existing law applicable to the Navy. The next three sentences establish and define the two types of enlistments that are now in effect in the Coast Guard, setting forth the basic difference in the two types. The last sentence continues a provision to the effect that original enlistments in the Coast Guard shall be temporary. This section is a combination of existing law and regulations in regard to enlistments, with changes as noted above. See title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;35, and Coast Guard Regulations, sections 531 and 532. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Secretary may, under regulations prescribed by him, award a Life-saving medal of gold or silver to any individual, including personnel of the Coast Guard, who rescues or endeavors to rescue any other individual from drowning, shipwreck, or other peril of the water in accordance with the following provisions:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) if such rescue or attempted rescue is made at the risk of one's own life and evidences extreme and heroic daring, the medal shall be of gold;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if such rescue or attempted rescue is not sufficiently distinguished to deserve the medal of gold, but evidences the exercise of such signal exertion as to merit recognition, the medal shall be of silver.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) In order for an individual to be eligible for the Life-saving Medals the rescue or attempted rescue must take place in waters within the United States or subject to the jurisdiction thereof, or if the rescue or attempted rescue takes place outside such waters, one or the other of the parties must be a citizen of the United States or from a vessel or aircraft owned or operated by citizens of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) No individual shall receive more than one gold medal and one silver medal; but any individual who has received or may hereafter receive a gold or silver medal and who again performs an act which would entitle him to receive another medal of the same class may be awarded, in lieu of a second medal of the same class, a gold or silver bar, as the case may be, to be worn with the medal already bestowed, and for every such additional act, an additional bar may be awarded. Medals and bars in lieu thereof, authorized by this subsection, may be awarded posthumously.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;&sect;193, 194, 195, 196 (June 20, 1874, ch. 344, &sect;7, 18 Stat. 127; June 18, 1878, ch. 265, &sect;12, 20 Stat. 165; May 4, 1882, ch. 117, &sect;9, 22 Stat. 57; Jan. 21, 1897, ch. 83, 29 Stat. 494).</p>
<p class="note-body">Said sections have been rewritten so as to make the awarding of Life-saving medals turn on whether or not the United States has an interest in the heroic act, rather than on technical jurisdictional grounds. Under existing law the award of a medal could be made in any case in which the rescuer or the rescued was a citizen <!-- PDFPage:180 -->of the United States, or was from a vessel owned or operated by the United States regardless of where the rescue took place; and if the rescue took place within waters of the United States the award could be made to an alien.</p>
<p class="note-body">The existing law relating to the Treasury Department Life-Saving Medal contained in title 14, U.S.C., 1946, ed., &sect;&sect;192&ndash;196, has long needed revision. The existing law is composed of a series of statutes enacted separately between 1874 and 1897, and the result has not been entirely unsatisfactory. The original statute, enacted in 1874 (title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;193), provided for Life-saving medals of the first and second class to be bestowed &quot;upon any persons who shall hereafter endanger their own lives in saving, or endeavoring to save lives from the perils of the sea, within the United States, or upon any American vessel&quot;. The medal of the first class was confined to cases of &quot;extreme and heroic daring&quot; and the medal of the second class was to be awarded &quot;in cases not sufficiently distinguished to deserve the medal of the first class&quot; Then in 1878 another act was passed (title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;194) authorizing the bestowal of the medal of the second class &quot;upon persons making such signal exertions in rescuing and succoring the shipwrecked, and saving persons from drowning&quot; as, in the opinion of the Secretary of the Treasury, merited recognition. These two sections were construed by the Attorney General to be limited to the rescue of persons who were subjected to the perils of the sea in any waters of the United States in the vicinity of any lifeboat station, life-saving station, or house of refuge. And the person upon whom the medal could be bestowed was limited to members of life-saving crews. (1895) Op. Att. Gen. 124. Thereupon, in 1897, an act was passed which provided that the two earlier acts should &quot;be construed so as to empower the Secretary of the Treasury to bestow such medals upon persons making signal exertions in rescuing and succoring the shipwrecked and saving persons from drowning in waters over which the United States has jurisdiction, whether the said persons making such exertions were or were not members of the Life-Saving Service or whether or not such exertions were made in the vicinity of a life-saving station&quot;. (Title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;196.) This act was designed to give a more liberal application to the two earlier acts, and all three were to be read as one. (1900) 23 Op. Atty. Gen. 78. However, difficult questions of interpretation have arisen because of the different jurisdictional language in the three acts. For example, title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;193, refers to rescues &quot;within the United States&quot;, while title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;196, refers to rescues &quot;in the waters over which the United States has jurisdiction&quot;. The need for clarification is obvious. Subsection (a) authorizes the awarding of the medal to any person, including Coast Guard personnel, who rescues or endeavors to rescue any person from drowning, shipwreck, or peril of the water. If the rescue or attempted rescue is at the risk of one's own life and evidences extreme and heroic daring, the medal shall be of gold, and if the rescue or attempted rescue is not sufficiently distinguished to deserve the gold medal, but evidences the exertion of such signal exertion as to merit recognition, the medal shall be of silver. Thus, the acts for which the medals are to be awarded are defined simply and without any geographical or jurisdictional limitations. The difficulty with the existing law is the attempt to define the required deed together with those limitations. Subsection (a) does not change existing law insofar as the type of act necessary for the medals is concerned; it merely simplifies and clarifies existing law.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (b) contains the jurisdictional limitations on the awarding of the medal and broadens, to a considerable extent, the provisions of existing law. It is the intent of this subsection to authorize the awarding of a medal in all cases where the United States has a legitimate interest in recognizing meritorious acts, such as where a United States citizen performs the act, or where a United States citizen is rescued, or where United States waters or United States vessels or aircraft are involved. Accordingly, rescues by United States citizens anywhere in the world will be recognized. Any person, including persons not citizens of the United States, may receive medals if the rescue or attempted rescue takes place in waters within the United States or subject to its jurisdiction or, in cases of rescues outside such waters, if either the rescuer or the person rescued is from a United States vessel or aircraft, or the person rescued is a United States citizen. Thus, every case in which the United States government has an interest is provided for. A United States citizen who performs a heroic act sufficient to justify a medal in state waters, or in foreign waters, could not receive one under existing law, but could receive such award under this proposed revision. The awarding of medals should not turn on technical jurisdictional grounds; it should turn rather on the interest of the United States to recognize noble and heroic acts.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (c) dealing with the awarding of bars for additional acts, clarifies, but does not change title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;195, except that authority is granted to award medals posthumously. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;&sect;20a, 121 (May 18, 1920, ch. 190, &sect;8, 41 Stat. 603; June 10, 1922, ch. 212, 42 Stat. 625; July 3, 1926, ch. 742, &sect;10, 44 Stat. 817).</p>
<p class="note-body">Said section 121 was omitted from the 1940 and 1946 editions of the U.S. Code, but it has been held that the assimilation provision thereof is inoperative only insofar as Congress has made specific legislative provision for the Coast Guard, and that benefits derived from legislation pertaining to the Navy previously conferred upon the Coast Guard, and not provided for in subsequent legislation, survive to the Coast Guard under the assimilation statute. (See 27 Comp. Dec. 234; 22 Comp. Gen. 723; decision of June 9, 1947, B&ndash;63472; decision of April 2, 1948, B&ndash;70438; and decision of September 2, 1948, B&ndash;77295.)</p>
<p class="note-body">It seems desirable to retain this assimilation provision as to pay in order to cover any failure to provide specifically for the Coast Guard in military pay legislation.</p>
<p class="note-body">This section assimilates the pay of military personnel of the Coast Guard to the pay of military personnel of the Navy. It seems that this is the most feasible method of insuring that the pay of military personnel of the Coast Guard will not vary from the pay of military personnel of the other armed forces. The assimilation is intended to include authorization for extra pay and allowances as provided for personnel of the Navy, for all types of special duty: for example, qualified divers on diving duty, military personnel assigned to submarine duty, military personnel assigned to aviation duty, officers assigned as aides to flag officers, and enlisted persons assigned to duty in the mess detail. Military pay acts are intended to include Coast Guard personnel specifically; this section would cover any failure to so provide for Coast Guard personnel in a pay act.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->

<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Secretary is authorized to lease housing facilities at or near Coast Guard installations, wherever located, for assignment as public quarters to military personnel and their de<!-- PDFPage:198 -->pendents, if any, without rental charge upon a determination by the Secretary, or his designee, that there is a lack of adequate housing facilities at or near such Coast Guard installations. The Secretary is also authorized to lease housing facilities for assignment as public quarters, without rental charge, to military personnel who are on sea duty or duty at remote offshore Coast Guard stations and who do not have dependents. Such authority shall be effective in any fiscal year only to such extent or in such amounts as are provided in appropriation Acts. When any such lease involves housing facilities in a foreign country, the lease may be made on a multiyear basis for a period not to exceed five years, and, in accordance with local custom and practice, advance payment may be made for the lease. Such public housing facilities may be leased on an individual or multiple-unit basis. Expenditures for the rental of such housing facilities may not exceed the average authorized for the Department of Defense in any year except where the Secretary finds that the average is so low as to prevent rental of necessary housing facilities in some areas, in which event he is authorized to reallocate existing funds to high-cost areas so that rental expenditures in such areas exceed the average authorized for the Department of Defense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Secretary is authorized, subject to regulations approved by the President&mdash;</p>
