<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Order in which unpaid claims are to be paid</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If at any time the Superfund has insufficient funds to pay all of the claims payable out of the Superfund at such time, such claims shall, to the extent permitted under paragraph (1), be paid in full in the order in which they were finally determined.</p>
