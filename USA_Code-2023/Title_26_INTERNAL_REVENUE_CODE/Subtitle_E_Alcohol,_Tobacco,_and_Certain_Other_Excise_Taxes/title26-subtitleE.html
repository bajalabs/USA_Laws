<h3 class="section-head">&sect;5006. Determination of tax</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Requirements</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as otherwise provided in this section, the tax on distilled spirits shall be determined when the spirits are withdrawn from bond. Such tax shall be determined by such means as the Secretary shall by regulations prescribe, and with the use of such devices and apparatus (including but not limited to tanks and pipelines) as the Secretary may require. The tax on distilled spirits withdrawn from the bonded premises of a distilled spirits plant shall be determined upon completion of the gauge for determination of tax and before withdrawal from bonded premises, under such regulations as the Secretary shall prescribe.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Distilled spirits not accounted for</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary finds that the distiller has not accounted for all the distilled spirits produced by him, he shall, from all the evidence he can obtain, determine what quantity of distilled spirits was actually produced by such distiller, and an assessment shall be made for the difference between the quantity reported and the quantity shown to have been actually produced at the rate of tax imposed by law for every proof gallon.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Taxable loss</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) On original quantity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Where there is evidence satisfactory to the Secretary that there has been any loss of distilled spirits from any cask or other package deposited on bonded premises, other than a loss which by reason of section 5008(a) is not taxable, the Secretary may require the withdrawal from bonded premises of such distilled spirits, and direct the officer designated by him to collect the tax accrued on the original quantity of distilled spirits entered for deposit on bonded premises in such cask or package; except that, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, when the extent of any loss from causes other than theft or unauthorized voluntary destruction can be established by the proprietor to the satisfaction of the Secretary an allowance of the tax on the loss so established may be credited against the tax on the original quantity. If such tax is not paid on demand it shall be assessed and collected as other taxes are assessed and collected.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Alternative method</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Where there is evidence satisfactory to the Secretary that there has been access, other than is authorized by law, to the contents of casks or packages stored on bonded premises, and the extent of such access is such as to evidence a lack of due diligence or a failure to employ necessary and effective controls on the part of the proprietor, the Secretary (in lieu of requiring the casks or packages to which such access has been had to be withdrawn and tax paid on the original quantity of distilled spirits entered for deposit on bonded premises in such casks or packages as provided in paragraph (1)) may assess an amount equal to the tax on 5 proof gallons of distilled spirits at the prevailing rate on each of the total number of such casks or packages as determined by him.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Application of subsection</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The provisions of this subsection shall apply to distilled spirits which are filled into casks or packages, as authorized by law, after entry and deposit on bonded premises, whether by recasking, filling from storage tanks, consolidation of packages, or otherwise; and the quantity filled into such casks or packages shall be deemed to be the original quantity for the purpose of this subsection, in the case of loss from such casks or packages.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Distilled spirits not bonded</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The tax on any distilled spirits, removed from the place where they were distilled and (except as otherwise provided by law) not deposited in storage on bonded premises of a distilled spirits plant, shall, at any time within the period of limitation provided in section 6501, when knowledge of such fact is obtained by the Secretary, be assessed on the distiller of such distilled spirits (or other person liable for the tax) and payment of such tax immediately demanded and, on the neglect or refusal of payment, the Secretary shall proceed to collect the same by distraint. This paragraph shall not exclude any other remedy or proceeding provided by law.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Production at other than qualified plants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as otherwise provided by law, the tax on any distilled spirits produced in the United States at any place other than a qualified distilled spirits plant shall be due and payable immediately upon production.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Unlawfully imported distilled spirits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Distilled spirits smuggled or brought into the United States unlawfully shall, for purposes of this chapter, be held to be imported into the United States, and the internal revenue tax shall be due and payable at the time of such importation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Cross reference</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Voluntary destruction</h4>

In every case where it appears that the loss was by theft, the burden shall be upon the proprietor of the distilled spirits plant or other person responsible for the distilled spirits tax to establish to the satisfaction of the Secretary that such loss did not occur as the result of connivance, collusion, fraud, or negligence on the part of the proprietor of the distilled spirits plant, owner, consignor, consignee, bailee, or carrier, or the employees or agents of any of them.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Refund of tax</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The proprietor of the distilled spirits plant or other persons liable for the tax imposed by this chapter or by section 7652 with respect to any distilled spirits in bond may voluntarily destroy such spirits, but only if such destruction is under such supervision and under such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Claim must be filed within 6 months of return of spirits</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">All provisions of law, including penalties, applicable in respect of the internal revenue tax on distilled spirits, shall, insofar as applicable and not inconsistent with subsection (c), be applicable to the credits or refunds provided for under such subsection to the same extent as if such credits or refunds constituted credits or refunds of such tax.</p>

<!-- PDFPage:3159 --><p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) procedures that allow for revocation of eligibility of the brewer and the importer for the reduced tax rate provided under this paragraph in the case of any erroneous or fraudulent information provided under clause (iii) which the Secretary deems to be material to qualifying for such reduced rate.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Controlled group</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Subject to regulations prescribed by the Secretary, the tax paid by any brewer on beer removed for consumption or sale may be refunded or credited to the brewer, without interest, or if the tax has not been paid, the brewer may be relieved of liability therefor, if such beer is lost, whether by theft or otherwise, or is destroyed or otherwise rendered unmerchantable by fire, casualty, or act of God before the transfer of title thereto to any other person. In any case in which beer is lost or destroyed, whether by theft or otherwise, the Secretary may require the brewer to file a claim for relief from the tax and submit proof as to the cause of such loss. In every case where it appears that the loss was by theft, the first sentence shall not apply unless the brewer establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary that such theft occurred before removal from the brewery and occurred without connivance, collusion, fraud, or negligence on the part of the brewer, consignor, consignee, bailee, or carrier, or the employees or agents of any of them.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Beer received at a distilled spirits plant</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any tax paid by any brewer on beer removed for consumption or sale may be refunded or credited to the brewer, without interest, or if the tax has not been paid, the brewer may be relieved of liability therefor, under regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, if such beer is received on the bonded premises of a distilled spirits plant pursuant to the provisions of section 5222(b)(2), for use in the production of distilled spirits.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No claim under this section shall be allowed (1) unless filed within 6 months after the date of the return, loss, destruction, rendering unmerchantable, or receipt on the bonded premises of a distilled spirits plant or (2) if the claimant was indemnified by insurance or otherwise in respect of the tax.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Such drawback shall be due and payable quarterly upon filing of a proper claim with the Secretary; except that, where any person entitled to <!-- PDFPage:3177 -->such drawback shall elect in writing to file monthly claims therefor, such drawback shall be due and payable monthly upon filing of a proper claim with the Secretary.

Any such election may be revoked on filing of notice thereof with the Secretary. No claim under this subpart shall be allowed unless filed with the Secretary within the 6 months next succeeding the quarter in which the distilled spirits covered by the claim were used as provided in this subpart.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Allowance of drawback even where certain requirements not met</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Penalty</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a failure to comply with any requirement imposed under this subpart or any rule or regulation issued thereunder, the claimant shall be liable for a penalty of $1,000 for each failure to comply unless it is shown that the failure to comply was due to reasonable cause.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Requirements</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Distilled spirits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Every wholesale dealer in liquors who sells distilled spirits to other dealers shall keep daily a record of distilled spirits received and disposed of by him, in such form and at such place and containing such information, and shall submit correct summaries of such records to the Secretary at such time and in such form and manner, as the Secretary shall by regulations prescribe. Such dealer shall also submit correct extracts from or copies of such records, at such time and in such form and manner as the Secretary may by regulations prescribe; however, the Secretary may on application by such dealer, in accordance with such regulations, relieve him from this requirement until further notice, whenever the Secretary deems that the submission of such extracts or copies serves no useful purpose in law enforcement or in protection of the revenue.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Wines and beer</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Every wholesale dealer in liquors and every wholesale dealer in beer shall provide and keep, at such place as the Secretary shall by regulations prescribe, a record in book form of all wines and beer received, showing the quantities thereof and from whom and the dates received, or shall keep all invoices of, and bills for, all wines and beer received.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Exemption of States, political subdivisions, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The provision of subsection (a) shall not apply to a State, to a political subdivision of a State, to the District of Columbia, or to liquor stores operated by any of them, if they maintain and make available for inspection by internal revenue officers such records as will enable such officers to trace all distilled spirits, wines, and beer received, and all distilled spirits disposed of by them. Such States, subdivisions, District, or liquor stores shall, upon the request of the Secretary, furnish him such transcripts, summaries and copies of their records with respect to distilled spirits as he shall require.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Wholesale dealers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this part&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Wholesale dealer in liquors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &quot;wholesale dealer in liquors&quot; means any dealer (other than a wholesale dealer in beer) who sells, or offers for sale, distilled spirits, wines, or beer, to another dealer.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Wholesale dealer in beer</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &quot;wholesale dealer in beer&quot; means any dealer who sells, or offers for sale, beer, but not distilled spirits or wines, to another dealer.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Dealer</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &quot;dealer&quot; means any person who sells, or offers for sale, any distilled spirits, wines, or beer.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Presumption in case of sale of 20 wine gallons or more</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The sale, or offer for sale, of distilled spirits, wines, or beer, in quantities of 20 wine gallons or more to the same person at the same time, shall be presumptive evidence that the person making such sale, or offer for sale, is engaged in or carrying on the business of a wholesale dealer in liquors or a wholesale dealer in beer, as the case may be. Such presumption may be overcome by evidence satisfactorily showing that such sale, or offer for sale, was made to a person other than a dealer.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Cross references</h4>
<p class="note-body-2em"><strong>(1) For provisions requiring proprietors of distilled spirits plants to keep records and submit reports of receipts and dispositions of distilled spirits, see section 5207.</strong></p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) fresh or dried fruit, or their residues,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the wine or wine residues, therefrom, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) special natural wine under such conditions as the Secretary may by regulations prescribe;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">except that where, in the production of natural wine or special natural wine, sugar has been used, the wine or the residuum thereof may not be used if the unfermented sugars therein have been refermented. Such wine spirits shall not be reduced with water from distillation proof, nor be distilled, unless regulations otherwise provide, at less than 140 degrees of proof (except that commercial brandy aged in wood for a period of not less than 2 years, and barreled at not less than 100 degrees of proof, shall be deemed wine spirits for the purpose of this subsection).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Withdrawal of wine spirits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The proprietor of any bonded wine cellar may withdraw and receive wine spirits without payment of tax from the bonded premises of any distilled spirits plant, or from any bonded wine cellar as provided in paragraph (2), for use in the production of natural wine, for addition to concentrated or unconcentrated juice for use in wine production, or for such other uses as may be authorized in this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Wine spirits so withdrawn, and not used in wine production or as otherwise authorized in this subchapter, may, as provided by regulations prescribed by the Secretary, be transferred to the bonded premises of any distilled spirits plant or bonded wine cellar, or may be taxpaid and removed as provided by law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) On such use, transfer, or taxpayment, the Secretary shall credit the proprietor with the amount of wine spirits so used or transferred or taxpaid and, in addition, with such portion of wine spirits so withdrawn as may have been lost either in transit or on the bonded wine cellar premises, to the extent allowable under section 5008(a). Where the proprietor has used wine spirits in actual wine production but in violation of the requirements of this subchapter, the Secretary shall also extend such credit to the wine spirits so used if the proprietor satisfactorily shows that such wine spirits were not knowingly used in violation of law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Suitable samples of brandy or wine spirits may, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, be withdrawn free of tax from the bonded premises of any distilled spirits plant, bonded wine cellar, or authorized experimental premises, for analysis or testing.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Distillates containing aldehydes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When the Secretary deems such removal and use will not jeopardize the revenue nor unduly increase administrative supervision, distillates containing aldehydes may, under such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, be removed without payment of tax from the bonded premises of a distilled spirits plant to an adjacent bonded wine cellar and used therein in fermentation of wine to be used as distilling material at the distilled spirits plant from which such unfinished distilled spirits were removed.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Proper cellar treatment</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Proper cellar treatment of natural wine constitutes&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) subject to paragraph (2), those practices and procedures in the United States, whether historical or newly developed, of using various methods and materials to correct or stabilize the wine, or the fruit juice from which it is made, so as to produce a finished product acceptable in good commercial practice in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) subject to paragraph (3), in the case of wine produced and imported subject to an international agreement or treaty, those practices and procedures acceptable to the United States under such agreement or treaty.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Recognition of continuing treatment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1)(A), where a particular treatment has been used in customary commercial practice in the United States, it shall continue to be recognized as a proper cellar treatment in the absence of regulations prescribed by the Secretary finding such treatment not to be proper cellar treatment within the meaning of this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Certification of practices and procedures for imported wine</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of imported wine produced after December 31, 2004, the Secretary shall accept the practices and procedures used to produce such wine, if, at the time of importation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the Secretary has on file or is provided with a certification from the government of the producing country, accompanied by an affirmed laboratory analysis, that the practices and procedures used to produce the wine constitute proper cellar treatment under paragraph (1)(A),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the Secretary has on file or is provided with such certification, if any, as may be required by an international agreement or treaty under paragraph (1)(B), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) in the case of an importer that owns or controls or that has an affiliate that owns or controls a winery operating under a basic permit issued by the Secretary, the importer certifies that the practices and procedures used to produce the wine constitute proper cellar treatment under paragraph (1)(A).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Affiliate defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this paragraph, the term &quot;affiliate&quot; has the meaning given such term by section 117(a)(4) of the Federal Alcohol Administration Act (27 U.S.C. 211(a)(4)) and includes a winery's parent or subsidiary or any other entity in which the winery's parent or subsidiary has an ownership interest.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Specifically authorized treatments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The practices and procedures specifically enumerated in this subsection shall be deemed proper cellar treatment for natural wine:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The preparation and use of pure concentrated or unconcentrated juice or must. Concentrated juice or must reduced with water to its original density or to not less than 22 degrees Brix or unconcentrated juice or must reduced with water to not less than 22 degrees Brix shall be deemed to be juice or must, and shall include such amounts of water to clear crushing equipment as regulations prescribed by the Secretary may provide.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The addition to natural wine, or to concentrated or unconcentrated juice or must, from one kind of fruit, of wine spirits (whether or not tax-paid) distilled in the United States <!-- PDFPage:3221 -->from the same kind of fruit; except that (A) the wine, juice, or concentrate shall not have an alcoholic content in excess of 24 percent by volume after the addition of wine spirits, and (B) in the case of still wines, wine spirits may be added in any State only to natural wines produced by fermentation in bonded wine cellars located within the same State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Amelioration and sweetening of natural grape wines in accordance with section 5383.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Amelioration and sweetening of natural wines from fruits other than grapes in accordance with section 5384.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) In the case of effervescent wines, such preparations for refermentation and for dosage as may be acceptable in good commercial practice, but only if the alcoholic content of the finished product does not exceed 14 percent by volume.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The natural darkening of the sugars or other elements in juice, must, or wine due to storage, concentration, heating processes, or natural oxidation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) The blending of natural wines with each other or with heavy-bodied blending wine or with concentrated or unconcentrated juice, whether or not such juice contains wine spirits, if the wines, juice, or wine spirits are from the same kind of fruit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) Such use of acids to correct natural deficiencies and stabilize the wine as may be acceptable in good commercial practice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) The addition&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to natural grape or berry wine of the winemaker's own production, of volatile fruit-flavor concentrate produced from the same kind and variety of grape or berry at a plant qualified under section 5511, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to natural fruit wine (other than grape or berry) of the winemaker's own production, of volatile fruit-flavor concentrate produced from the same kind of fruit at such a plant,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">so long as the proportion of the volatile fruit-flavor concentrate to the wine does not exceed the proportion of the volatile fruit-flavor concentrate to the original juice or must from which it was produced. The transfer of volatile fruit-flavor concentrate from a plant qualified under section 5511 to a bonded wine cellar and its storage and use in such a cellar shall be under such applications and bonds, and under such other requirements, as may be provided in regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Other authorized treatment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may by regulations prescribe limitations on the preparation and use of clarifying, stabilizing, preserving, fermenting, and corrective methods or materials, to the extent that such preparation or use is not acceptable in good commercial practice.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Use of juice or must from which volatile fruit flavor has been removed</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this part, juice, concentrated juice, or must processed at a plant qualified under section 5511 may be deemed to be pure juice, concentrated juice, or must even though volatile fruit flavor has been removed if, at a plant qualified under section 5511 or at the bonded wine cellar, there is added to such juice, concentrated juice, or must, or (in the case of a bonded wine cellar) to wine of the winemaker's own production made therefrom, either the identical volatile flavor removed or&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in the case of natural grape or berry wine of the winemaker's own production, an equivalent quantity of volatile fruit-flavor concentrate produced at such a plant and derived from the same kind and variety of grape or berry, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in the case of natural fruit wine (other than grape or berry wine) of the winemaker's own production, an equivalent quantity of volatile fruit-flavor concentrate produced at such a plant and derived from the same kind of fruit.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) High acid wines</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Amelioration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Before, during, and after fermentation, ameliorating materials consisting of pure dry sugar or liquid sugar, water, or a combination of sugar and water, may be added to natural grape wines of a winemaker's own production when such wines are made from juice having a natural fixed acid content of more than five parts per thousand (calculated before fermentation and as tartaric acid). Ameliorating material so added shall not reduce the natural fixed acid content of the juice to less than five parts per thousand, nor exceed 35 percent of the volume of juice (calculated exclusive of pulp) and ameliorating material combined.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Sweetening</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any wine produced under this subsection may be sweetened by the producer thereof, after amelioration and fermentation, with pure dry sugar or liquid sugar if the total solids content of the finished wine does not exceed (A) 17 percent by weight if the alcoholic content is more than 14 percent by volume, or (B) 21 percent by weight if the alcoholic content is not more than 14 percent by volume. The use under this paragraph of liquid sugar shall be limited to cases where the resultant volume does not exceed the volume which could result from the maximum authorized use of pure dry sugar only.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">To natural wine made from berries or fruit other than grapes, pure dry sugar or liquid sugar may be added to the juice in the fermenter, or to the wine after fermentation; but only if such wine has not more than 14 percent alcohol by volume after complete fermentation, or after complete fermentation and sweetening, and a total solids content not in excess of 21 percent by weight; and except that the use under this subsection of liquid sugar shall be limited so that the resultant volume will not exceed the volume which could result from the maximum authorized use of pure dry sugar only.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Ameliorated fruit and berry wines</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any natural fruit or berry wine (other than grape wine) of a winemaker's own production may, if not made under subsection (a) of this section, be ameliorated to correct high acid content. Ameliorating material calculations and ac<!-- PDFPage:3223 -->counting shall be separate for wines made from each different kind of fruit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Pure dry sugar or liquid sugar may be used in the production of wines under this subsection for the purpose of correcting natural deficiencies, but not to such an extent as would reduce the natural fixed acid in the corrected juice or wine to five parts per thousand. The quantity of sugar so used shall not exceed the quantity which would have been required to adjust the juice, prior to fermentation, to a total solids content of 25 degrees (Brix). Such sugar shall be added prior to the completion of fermentation of the wine.

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;5703. Liability for tax and method of payment</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Liability for tax</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Original liability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The manufacturer or importer of tobacco products and cigarette papers and tubes shall be liable for the taxes imposed thereon by section 5701.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Transfer of liability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">When tobacco products and cigarette papers and tubes are transferred, without payment of tax, pursuant to section 5704, the liability for tax shall be transferred in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph. When tobacco products and cigarette papers and tubes are transferred between the bonded premises of manufacturers and export warehouse proprietors, the transferee shall become liable for the tax upon receipt by him of such articles, and the transferor shall thereupon be relieved of his liability for such tax. When tobacco <!-- PDFPage:3263 -->products and cigarette papers and tubes are released in bond from customs custody for transfer to the bonded premises of a manufacturer of tobacco products or cigarette papers and tubes, the transferee shall become liable for the tax on such articles upon release from customs custody, and the importer shall thereupon be relieved of his liability for such tax. All provisions of this chapter applicable to tobacco products and cigarette papers and tubes in bond shall be applicable to such articles returned to bond upon withdrawal from the market or returned to bond after previous removal for a tax-exempt purpose.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Method of payment of tax</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The taxes imposed by section 5701 shall be determined at the time of removal of the tobacco products and cigarette papers and tubes. Such taxes shall be paid on the basis of return. The Secretary shall, by regulations, prescribe the period or the event for which such return shall be made and the information to be furnished on such return. Any postponement under this subsection of the payment of taxes determined at the time of removal shall be conditioned upon the filing of such additional bonds, and upon compliance with such requirements, as the Secretary may prescribe for the protection of the revenue. The Secretary may, by regulations, require payment of tax on the basis of a return prior to removal of the tobacco products and cigarette papers and tubes where a person defaults in the postponed payment of tax on the basis of a return under this subsection or regulations prescribed thereunder. All administrative and penalty provisions of this title, insofar as applicable, shall apply to any tax imposed by section 5701.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Time for payment of taxes</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, in the case of taxes on tobacco products and cigarette papers and tubes removed during any semimonthly period under bond for deferred payment of tax, the last day for payment of such taxes shall be the 14th day after the last day of such semimonthly period.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Imported articles</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of tobacco products and cigarette papers and tubes which are imported into the United States&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The last day for payment of tax shall be the 14th day after the last day of the semimonthly period during which the article is entered into the customs territory of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Special rule for entry for warehousing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Except as provided in clause (iv), in the case of an entry for warehousing, the last day for payment of tax shall not be later than the 14th day after the last day of the semimonthly period during which the article is removed from the 1st such warehouse.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Foreign trade zones</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Except as provided in clause (iv) and in regulations prescribed by the Secretary, articles brought into a foreign trade zone shall, notwithstanding any other provision of law, be treated for purposes of this subsection as if such zone were a single customs warehouse.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iv) Exception for articles destined for export</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Clauses (ii) and (iii) shall not apply to any article which is shown to the satisfaction of the Secretary to be destined for export.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Tobacco products and cigarette papers and tubes brought into the United States from Puerto Rico</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of tobacco products and cigarette papers and tubes which are brought into the United States from Puerto Rico, the last day for payment of tax shall be the 14th day after the last day of the semimonthly period during which the article is brought into the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Special rule for tax due in September</h4>

<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Safe harbor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The requirement of clause (i) shall be treated as met if the amount paid not later than September 29 is not less than 11/15 of the taxes on tobacco products and cigarette papers and tubes for the period beginning on September 1 and ending on September 15.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Taxpayers not required to use electronic funds transfer</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In the case of payments not required to be made by electronic funds transfer, clauses (i) and (ii) shall be applied by substituting &quot;September 25&quot; for &quot;September 26&quot;, &quot;September 28&quot; for &quot;September 29&quot;, and &quot;2/3&quot; for &quot;11/15&quot;.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Special rule where due date falls on Saturday, Sunday, or holiday</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding section 7503, if, but for this subparagraph, the due date under this paragraph would fall on a Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday (as defined in section 7503), such due date shall be the immediately preceding day which is not a Saturday, Sunday, or such a holiday (or the immediately following day where the due date described in subparagraph (D) falls on a Sunday).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(F) Special rule for unlawfully manufactured tobacco products</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of any tobacco products, cigarette paper, or cigarette tubes manufactured in the United States at any place other than the premises of a manufacturer of tobacco products, cigarette paper, or cigarette tubes <!-- PDFPage:3264 -->that has filed the bond and obtained the permit required under this chapter, tax shall be due and payable immediately upon manufacture.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Payment by electronic fund transfer</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any person who in any 12-month period, ending December 31, was liable for a gross amount equal to or exceeding $5,000,000 in taxes imposed on tobacco products and cigarette papers and tubes by section 5701 (or 7652) shall pay such taxes during the succeeding calendar year by electronic fund transfer (as defined in section 5061(e)(2)) to a Federal Reserve Bank. Rules similar to the rules of section 5061(e)(3) shall apply to the $5,000,000 amount specified in the preceding sentence.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Use of government depositaries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may authorize Federal Reserve banks, and incorporated banks or trust companies which are depositaries or financial agents of the United States, to receive any tax imposed by this chapter, in such manner, at such times, and under such conditions as he may prescribe; and he shall prescribe the manner, time, and condition under which the receipt of such tax by such banks and trust companies is to be treated as payment for tax purposes.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Assessment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever any tax required to be paid by this chapter is not paid in full at the time required for such payment, it shall be the duty of the Secretary, subject to the limitations prescribed in section 6501, on proof satisfactory to him, to determine the amount of tax which has been omitted to be paid, and to make an assessment therefor against the person liable for the tax. The tax so assessed shall be in addition to the penalties imposed by law for failure to pay such tax when required. Except in cases where delay may jeopardize collection of the tax, or where the amount is nominal or the result of an evident mathematical error, no such assessment shall be made until and after the person liable for the tax has been afforded reasonable notice and opportunity to show cause, in writing, against such assessment.</p>
