Such election, once made, shall be irrevocable. No election may be made under this subparagraph if such return is filed after the time prescribed by law (including extensions) for filing such return.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a tax on a gift has been paid under chapter 12 (sec. 2501 and following), or under corresponding provisions of prior laws, and thereafter on the death of the donor any amount in respect of such gift is required to be included in the value of the gross estate of the decedent for purposes of this chapter, then there shall be credited against the tax imposed by section 2001 the amount of the tax paid on a gift under chapter 12, or under corresponding provisions of prior laws, with respect to so much of the property which constituted the gift as is included in the gross estate, except that the amount of such credit shall not exceed an amount which bears the same ratio to the tax imposed by section 2001 (after deducting from such tax the unified credit provided by section 2010) as the value (at the time of the gift or at the time of the death, whichever is lower) of so much of the property which constituted the gift as is included in the gross estate bears to the value of the entire gross estate reduced by the aggregate amount of the charitable and marital deductions allowed under sections 2055, 2056, and 2106(a)(2).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Valuation reductions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In applying, with respect to any gift, the ratio stated in subsection (a), the value at the time of the gift or at the time of the death, referred to in such ratio, shall be reduced&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:2570 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) by such amount as will properly reflect the amount of such gift which was excluded in determining (for purposes of section 2503(a)), or of corresponding provisions of prior laws, the total amount of gifts made during the calendar quarter (or calendar year if the gift was made before January 1, 1971) in which the gift was made;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if a deduction with respect to such gift is allowed under section 2056(a) (relating to marital deduction), then by the amount of such value, reduced as provided in paragraph (1); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) if a deduction with respect to such gift is allowed under sections 2055 or 2106(a)(2) (relating to charitable deduction), then by the amount of such value, reduced as provided in paragraph (1) of this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Where gift considered made one-half by spouse</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Where the decedent was the donor of the gift but, under the provisions of section 2513, or corresponding provisions of prior laws, the gift was considered as made one-half by his spouse&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the term &quot;the amount of the tax paid on a gift under chapter 12&quot;, as used in subsection (a), includes the amounts paid with respect to each half of such gift, the amount paid with respect to each being computed in the manner provided in subsection (d); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in applying, with respect to such gift, the ratio stated in subsection (a), the value at the time of the gift or at the time of the death, referred to in such ratio, includes such value with respect to each half of such gift, each such value being reduced as provided in paragraph (1) of subsection (b).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Computation of amount of gift tax paid</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Amount of tax</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of subsection (a), the amount of tax paid on a gift under chapter 12, or under corresponding provisions of prior laws, with respect to any gift shall be an amount which bears the same ratio to the total tax paid for the calendar quarter (or calendar year if the gift was made before January 1, 1971) in which the gift was made as the amount of such gift bears to the total amount of taxable gifts (computed without deduction of the specific exemption) for such quarter or year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Amount of gift</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1), the &quot;amount of such gift&quot; shall be the amount included with respect to such gift in determining (for the purposes of section 2503(a), or of corresponding provisions of prior laws) the total amount of gifts made during such quarter or year, reduced by the amount of any deduction allowed with respect to such gift under section 2522, or under corresponding provisions of prior laws (relating to charitable deduction), or under section 2523 (relating to marital deduction).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Section inapplicable to gifts made after December 31, 1976</h4>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2013. Credit for tax on prior transfers</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The tax imposed by section 2001 shall be credited with all or a part of the amount of the Federal estate tax paid with respect to the transfer of property (including property passing as a result of the exercise or non-exercise of a power of appointment) to the decedent by or from a person (herein designated as a &quot;transferor&quot;) who died within 10 years before, or within 2 years after, the decedent's death. If the transferor died within 2 years of the death of the decedent, the credit shall be the amount determined under subsections (b) and (c). If the transferor predeceased the decedent by more than 2 years, the credit shall be the following percentage of the amount so determined&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) 80 percent, if within the third or fourth years preceding the decedent's death;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) 60 percent, if within the fifth or sixth years preceding the decedent's death;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) 40 percent, if within the seventh or eighth years preceding the decedent's death; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) 20 percent, if within the ninth or tenth years preceding the decedent's death.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Computation of credit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to the limitation prescribed in subsection (c), the credit provided by this section shall be an amount which bears the same ratio to the estate tax paid (adjusted as indicated hereinafter) with respect to the estate of the transferor as the value of the property transferred bears to the taxable estate of the transferor (determined for purposes of the estate tax) decreased by any death taxes paid with respect to such estate. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the estate tax paid shall be the Federal estate tax paid increased by any credits allowed against such estate tax under section 2012, or corresponding provisions of prior laws, on account of gift tax, and for any credits allowed against such estate tax under this section on account of prior transfers where the transferor acquired property from a person who died within 10 years before the death of the decedent.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Limitation on credit</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The credit provided in this section shall not exceed the amount by which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the estate tax imposed by section 2001 or section 2101 (after deducting the credits provided for in sections 2010, 2012, and 2014) computed without regard to this section, exceeds</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such tax computed by excluding from the decedent's gross estate the value of such property transferred and, if applicable, by making the adjustment hereinafter indicated.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">If any deduction is otherwise allowable under section 2055 or section 2106(a)(2) (relating to charitable deduction) then, for the purpose of the computation indicated in subparagraph (B), the amount of such deduction shall be reduced by that part of such deduction which the value of such property transferred bears to the decedent's entire gross estate reduced by the deductions allowed under sections 2053 and 2054, or section 2106(a)(1) (relating to deduction for expenses, losses, etc.). For purposes of this section, the value of such property transferred shall be the value as provided for in subsection (d) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Two or more transferors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the credit provided in this section relates to property received from 2 or more transferors, the limitation provided in paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be computed by aggregating the value of the property so transferred to the decedent. The aggregate limitation so determined shall be apportioned in accordance with the value of the property transferred to the decedent by each transferor.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Valuation of property transferred</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The value of property transferred to the decedent shall be the value used for the purpose of determining the Federal estate tax liability of the estate of the transferor but&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) there shall be taken into account the effect of the tax imposed by section 2001 or 2101, or any estate, succession, legacy, or inheritance tax, on the net value to the decedent of such property;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) where such property is encumbered in any manner, or where the decedent incurs any obligation imposed by the transferor with respect to such property, such encumbrance or obligation shall be taken into account in the same manner as if the amount of a gift to the decedent of such property was being determined; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) if the decedent was the spouse of the transferor at the time of the transferor's death, the net value of the property transferred to the decedent shall be reduced by the amount allowed under section 2056 (relating to marital deductions), as a deduction from the gross estate of the transferor.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Property defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term &quot;property&quot; includes any beneficial interest in property, including a general power of appointment (as defined in section 2041).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Treatment of additional tax imposed under section 2032A</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If section 2032A applies to any property included in the gross estate of the transferor and an additional tax is imposed with respect to such property under section 2032A(c) before the date which is 2 years after the date of the decedent's death, for purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the additional tax imposed by section 2032A(c) shall be treated as a Federal estate tax payable with respect to the estate of the transferor; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:2572 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the value of such property and the amount of the taxable estate of the transferor shall be determined as if section 2032A did not apply with respect to such property.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The value of the gross estate shall include the value of all property to the extent of any interest therein of which the decedent has at any time after September 7, 1916, made a transfer (except in case of a bona fide sale for an adequate and full consideration in money or money's worth), by trust or otherwise, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) possession or enjoyment of the property can, through ownership of such interest, be obtained only by surviving the decedent, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the decedent has retained a reversionary interest in the property (but in the case of a transfer made before October 8, 1949, only if such reversionary interest arose by the express terms of the instrument of transfer), and the value of such reversionary interest immediately before the death of the decedent exceeds 5 percent of the value of such property.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Special rules</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term &quot;reversionary interest&quot; includes a possibility that property transferred by the decedent&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) may return to him or his estate, or</p>
<!-- PDFPage:2591 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) may be subject to a power of disposition by him,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">but such term does not include a possibility that the income alone from such property may return to him or become subject to a power of disposition by him. The value of a reversionary interest immediately before the death of the decedent shall be determined (without regard to the fact of the decedent's death) by usual methods of valuation, including the use of tables of mortality and actuarial principles, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary. In determining the value of a possibility that property may be subject to a power of disposition by the decedent, such possibility shall be valued as if it were a possibility that such property may return to the decedent or his estate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an interest so transferred shall not be included in the decedent's gross estate under this section if possession or enjoyment of the property could have been obtained by any beneficiary during the decedent's life through the exercise of a general power of appointment (as defined in section 2041) which in fact was exercisable immediately before the decedent's death.</p>

In such cases proper adjustment shall be made representing the interests which would have been excluded from the power if the decedent had lived, and for such purpose, if the notice has not been given or the power has not been exercised on or before the date of his death, such notice shall be considered to have been given, or the power exercised, on the date of his death.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of the tax imposed by section 2001, the value of the taxable estate shall be determined by deducting from the value of the gross estate such amounts&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) for funeral expenses,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) for administration expenses,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) for claims against the estate, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) for unpaid mortgages on, or any indebtedness in respect of, property where the value of the decedent's interest therein, undiminished by such mortgage or indebtedness, is included in the value of the gross estate,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">as are allowable by the laws of the jurisdiction, whether within or without the United States, under which the estate is being administered.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Other administration expenses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to the limitations in paragraph (1) of subsection (c), there shall be deducted in determining the taxable estate amounts representing expenses incurred in administering property not subject to claims which is included in the gross estate to the same extent such amounts would be allowable as a deduction under subsection (a) if such property were subject to claims, and such amounts are paid before the expiration of the period of limitation for assessment provided in section 6501.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Limitations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Limitations applicable to subsections (a) and (b)</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Consideration for claims</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The deduction allowed by this section in the case of claims against the estate, unpaid mortgages, or any indebtedness shall, when founded on a promise or agreement, be limited to the extent that they were contracted bona fide and for an adequate and full consideration in money or money's worth; except that in any case in which any such claim is founded on a promise or agreement of the decedent to make a contribution or gift to or for the use of any donee described in section 2055 for the purposes specified therein, the deduction for such claims shall not be so limited, but shall be limited to the extent that it would be allowable as a deduction under section 2055 if such promise or agreement constituted a bequest.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Certain taxes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any income taxes on income received after the death of the decedent, or property taxes not accrued before his death, or any estate, succession, legacy, or inheritance taxes, shall not be deductible under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Certain claims by remaindermen</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">No deduction shall be allowed under this section for a claim against the estate by a remainderman relating to any property described in section 2044.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Section 6166 interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">No deduction shall be allowed under this section for any interest payable under section 6601 on any unpaid portion of the tax imposed by section 2001 for the period during which an extension of time for payment of such tax is in effect under section 6166.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Limitations applicable only to subsection (a)</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of the amounts described in subsection (a), there shall be disallowed the amount by which the deductions specified therein exceed the value, at the time of the decedent's death, of property subject to claims, except to the extent that such deductions represent amounts paid before the date prescribed for the filing of the estate tax return. For purposes of this section, the term &quot;property subject to claims&quot; means property includible in the gross estate of the decedent which, or the avails of which, would under the applicable law, bear the burden of the payment of such deductions in the final adjustment and settlement of the estate, except that the value of the property shall be reduced by the amount of the deduction under section 2054 attributable to such property.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Certain foreign death taxes</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (c)(1)(B), for purposes of the tax imposed by section 2001, the value of the taxable estate may be determined, if the executor so elects before the expiration of the period of limitation for assessment provided in section 6501, by deducting from the value of the gross estate the amount (as determined in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary) of any estate, succession, legacy, or inheritance tax imposed by and actually paid to any foreign country, in respect of any property situated within such foreign country and included in the gross estate of a citizen or resident of the United States, upon a transfer by the decedent for public, charitable, or religious uses described in section 2055. The determination under this paragraph of the country within which property is situated shall be made in accordance with the rules applicable under subchapter B (sec. 2101 and following) in determining whether property is situated within or without the United States. Any election under this paragraph shall be exercised in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Condition for allowance of deduction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No deduction shall be allowed under paragraph (1) for a foreign death tax specified therein unless the decrease in the tax imposed by section 2001 which results from the deduction provided in paragraph (1) will inure solely for the benefit of the public, charitable, or religious transferees described in section 2055 or section 2106(a)(2). In any case where the tax imposed by section 2001 is equitably apportioned among all the transferees of property included in the gross estate, including those described in sections 2055 and 2106(a)(2) (taking into account any exemptions, credits, or deductions allowed by this chapter), in determining such decrease, there shall be disregarded any decrease in the Federal estate <!-- PDFPage:2600 -->tax which any transferees other than those described in sections 2055 and 2106(a)(2) are required to pay.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Effect on credit for foreign death taxes of deduction under this subsection</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Election</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An election under this subsection shall be deemed a waiver of the right to claim a credit, against the Federal estate tax, under a death tax convention with any foreign country for any tax or portion thereof in respect of which a deduction is taken under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Cross reference</h4>
<p class="note-body-2em"><strong>See section 2014(f) for the effect of a deduction taken under this paragraph on the credit for foreign death taxes.</strong></p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Marital rights</h4>
<p class="note-body-2em"><strong>For provisions treating certain relinquishments of marital rights as consideration in money or money's worth, see section 2043(b)(2).</strong></p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Allowance of marital deduction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of the tax imposed by section 2001, the value of the taxable estate shall, except as limited by subsection (b), be determined by deducting from the value of the gross estate an amount equal to the value of any interest in property which passes or has passed from the decedent to his surviving spouse, but only to the extent that such interest is included in determining the value of the gross estate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Limitation in the case of life estate or other terminable interest</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Where, on the lapse of time, on the occurrence of an event or contingency, or on the failure of an event or contingency to occur, an interest passing to the surviving spouse will terminate or fail, no deduction shall be allowed under this section with respect to such interest&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) if an interest in such property passes or has passed (for less than an adequate and full consideration in money or money's worth) from the decedent to any person other than such surviving spouse (or the estate of such spouse); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if by reason of such passing such person (or his heirs or assigns) may possess or enjoy any part of such property after such termination or failure of the interest so passing to the surviving spouse;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">and no deduction shall be allowed with respect to such interest (even if such deduction is not disallowed under subparagraphs (A) and (B))&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) if such interest is to be acquired for the surviving spouse, pursuant to directions of the decedent, by his executor or by the trustee of a trust.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">For purposes of this paragraph, an interest shall not be considered as an interest which will terminate or fail merely because it is the ownership of a bond, note, or similar contractual obligation, the discharge of which would not have the effect of an annuity for life or for a term.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Interest in unidentified assets</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Where the assets (included in the decedent's gross estate) out of which, or the proceeds of which, an interest passing to the surviving spouse may be satisfied include a particular <!-- PDFPage:2608 -->asset or assets with respect to which no deduction would be allowed if such asset or assets passed from the decedent to such spouse, then the value of such interest passing to such spouse shall, for purposes of subsection (a), be reduced by the aggregate value of such particular assets.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Interest of spouse conditional on survival for limited period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, an interest passing to the surviving spouse shall not be considered as an interest which will terminate or fail on the death of such spouse if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) such death will cause a termination or failure of such interest only if it occurs within a period not exceeding 6 months after the decedent's death, or only if it occurs as a result of a common disaster resulting in the death of the decedent and the surviving spouse, or only if it occurs in the case of either such event; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such termination or failure does not in fact occur.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Valuation of interest passing to surviving spouse</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In determining for purposes of subsection (a) the value of any interest in property passing to the surviving spouse for which a deduction is allowed by this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) there shall be taken into account the effect which the tax imposed by section 2001, or any estate, succession, legacy, or inheritance tax, has on the net value to the surviving spouse of such interest; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) where such interest or property is encumbered in any manner, or where the surviving spouse incurs any obligation imposed by the decedent with respect to the passing of such interest, such encumbrance or obligation shall be taken into account in the same manner as if the amount of a gift to such spouse of such interest were being determined.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Life estate with power of appointment in surviving spouse</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of an interest in property passing from the decedent, if his surviving spouse is entitled for life to all the income from the entire interest, or all the income from a specific portion thereof, payable annually or at more frequent intervals, with power in the surviving spouse to appoint the entire interest, or such specific portion (exercisable in favor of such surviving spouse, or of the estate of such surviving spouse, or in favor of either, whether or not in each case the power is exercisable in favor of others), and with no power in any other person to appoint any part of the interest, or such specific portion, to any person other than the surviving spouse&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the interest or such portion thereof so passing shall, for purposes of subsection (a), be considered as passing to the surviving spouse, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) no part of the interest so passing shall, for purposes of paragraph (1)(A), be considered as passing to any person other than the surviving spouse.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">This paragraph shall apply only if such power in the surviving spouse to appoint the entire interest, or such specific portion thereof, whether exercisable by will or during life, is exercisable by such spouse alone and in all events.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Life insurance or annuity payments with power of appointment in surviving spouse</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of an interest in property passing from the decedent consisting of proceeds under a life insurance, endowment, or annuity contract, if under the terms of the contract such proceeds are payable in installments or are held by the insurer subject to an agreement to pay interest thereon (whether the proceeds, on the termination of any interest payments, are payable in a lump sum or in annual or more frequent installments), and such installment or interest payments are payable annually or at more frequent intervals, commencing not later than 13 months after the decedent's death, and all amounts, or a specific portion of all such amounts, payable during the life of the surviving spouse are payable only to such spouse, and such spouse has the power to appoint all amounts, or such specific portion, payable under such contract (exercisable in favor of such surviving spouse, or of the estate of such surviving spouse, or in favor of either, whether or not in each case the power is exercisable in favor of others), with no power in any other person to appoint such amounts to any person other than the surviving spouse&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) such amounts shall, for purposes of subsection (a), be considered as passing to the surviving spouse, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) no part of such amounts shall, for purposes of paragraph (1)(A), be considered as passing to any person other than the surviving spouse.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">This paragraph shall apply only if, under the terms of the contract, such power in the surviving spouse to appoint such amounts, whether exercisable by will or during life, is exercisable by such spouse alone and in all events.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Election with respect to life estate for surviving spouse</h4>

The executor, on payment of the amount of which he is notified (other than any amount the time for payment of which is extended under sections 6161, 6163, or 6166), and on furnishing any bond which may be required for any amount for which the time for payment is extended, shall be discharged from personal liability for any deficiency in tax thereafter found to be due and shall be entitled to a receipt or writing showing such discharge.</p>

Such application shall be accompanied by a copy of the instrument, if any, under which such fiduciary is acting, a description of the property held by the fiduciary, and such other information for purposes of carrying out the provisions of this section as the Secretary may require by regulations. On payment of the amount of such tax for which it has been determined the fiduciary is liable (other than any amount the time for payment of which has been extended under section 6161, 6163, or 6166), and on furnishing any bond which may be required for any amount for which the time for payment has been extended, or on receipt by him of notification of a determination that he is not liable for any such tax, the fiduciary shall be discharged from personal liability for any deficiency in such tax thereafter found to be due and shall be entitled to a receipt or writing evidencing such discharge.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Powers created on or before October 21, 1942</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An exercise of a general power of appointment created on or before October 21, 1942, shall be deemed a transfer of property by the individual possessing such power; but the failure to exercise such a power or the complete release of such a power shall not be deemed an exercise thereof. If a general power of appointment created on or before October 21, 1942, has been partially released so that it is no longer a general power of appointment, the subsequent exercise of such power shall not be deemed to be the exercise of a general power of appointment if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) such partial release occurred before November 1, 1951, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the donee of such power was under a legal disability to release such power on October 21, 1942, and such partial release occurred not later than six months after the termination of such legal disability.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Powers created after October 21, 1942</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The exercise or release of a general power of appointment created after October 21, 1942, shall be deemed a transfer of property by the individual possessing such power.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Definition of general power of appointment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term &quot;general power of appointment&quot; means a power which is exercisable in favor of the individual possessing the power (hereafter in this subsection referred to as the &quot;possessor&quot;), his estate, his creditors, or the creditors of his estate; except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) A power to consume, invade, or appropriate property for the benefit of the possessor which is limited by an ascertainable standard relating to the health, education, support, or maintenance of the possessor shall not be deemed a general power of appointment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) A power of appointment created on or before October 21, 1942, which is exercisable by the possessor only in conjunction with another person shall not be deemed a general power of appointment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) In the case of a power of appointment created after October 21, 1942, which is exercisable by the possessor only in conjunction with another person&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) if the power is not exercisable by the possessor except in conjunction with the creator of the power&mdash;such power shall not be deemed a general power of appointment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if the power is not exercisable by the possessor except in conjunction with a person having a substantial interest, in the property subject to the power, which is adverse to exercise of the power in favor of the possessor&mdash;such power shall not be deemed a general power of appointment. For the purposes of this subparagraph a person who, after the death of the possessor, may be possessed of a power of appointment (with respect to the property subject to the possessor's power) which he may exercise in his own favor shall be deemed as having an interest in the property and such interest shall be deemed adverse to such exercise of the possessor's power;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) if (after the application of subparagraphs (A) and (B)) the power is a general power of appointment and is exercisable in favor of such other person&mdash;such power shall be deemed a general power of appointment only in respect of a fractional part of the property subject to such power, such part to be determined by dividing the value of such property by the number of such persons (including the possessor) in favor of whom such power is exercisable.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">For purposes of subparagraphs (B) and (C), a power shall be deemed to be exercisable in favor of a person if it is exercisable in favor of such person, his estate, his creditors, or the creditors of his estate.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:2642 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Creation of another power in certain cases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a power of appointment created after October 21, 1942, is exercised by creating another power of appointment which, under the applicable local law, can be validly exercised so as to postpone the vesting of any estate or interest in the property which was subject to the first power, or suspend the absolute ownership or power of alienation of such property, for a period ascertainable without regard to the date of the creation of the first power, such exercise of the first power shall, to the extent of the property subject to the second power, be deemed a transfer of property by the individual possessing such power.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Lapse of power</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The lapse of a power of appointment created after October 21, 1942, during the life of the individual possessing the power shall be considered a release of such power. The rule of the preceding sentence shall apply with respect to the lapse of powers during any calendar year only to the extent that the property which could have been appointed by exercise of such lapsed powers exceeds in value the greater of the following amounts:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) $5,000, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) 5 percent of the aggregate value of the assets out of which, or the proceeds of which, the exercise of the lapsed powers could be satisfied.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Date of creation of power</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section a power of appointment created by a will executed on or before October 21, 1942, shall be considered a power created on or before such date if the person executing such will dies before July 1, 1949, without having republished such will, by codicil or otherwise, after October 21, 1942.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Allowance of deduction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Where a donor transfers during the calendar year by gift an interest in property to a donee who at the time of the gift is the donor's spouse, there shall be allowed as a deduction in computing taxable gifts for the calendar year an amount with respect to such interest equal to its value.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Life estate or other terminable interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Where, on the lapse of time, on the occurrence of an event or contingency, or on the failure of an event or contingency to occur, such interest transferred to the spouse will terminate or fail, no deduction shall be allowed with respect to such interest&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) if the donor retains in himself, or transfers or has transferred (for less than an adequate and full consideration in money or money's worth) to any person other than such donee spouse (or the estate of such spouse), an interest in such property, and if by reason of such retention or transfer the donor (or his heirs or assigns) or such person (or his heirs or assigns) may possess or enjoy any part of such property after such termination or failure of the interest transferred to the donee spouse; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if the donor immediately after the transfer to the donee spouse has a power to appoint an interest in such property which he can exercise (either alone or in conjunction with any person) in such manner that the appointee may possess or enjoy any part of such property after such termination or failure of the interest transferred to the donee spouse. For purposes of this paragraph, the donor shall be considered as having immediately after the <!-- PDFPage:2648 -->transfer to the donee spouse such power to appoint even though such power cannot be exercised until after the lapse of time, upon the occurrence of an event or contingency, or on the failure of an event or contingency to occur.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">An exercise or release at any time by the donor, either alone or in conjunction with any person, of a power to appoint an interest in property, even though not otherwise a transfer, shall, for purposes of paragraph (1), be considered as a transfer by him. Except as provided in subsection (e), where at the time of the transfer it is impossible to ascertain the particular person or persons who may receive from the donor an interest in property so transferred by him, such interest shall, for purposes of paragraph (1), be considered as transferred to a person other than the donee spouse.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Interest in unidentified assets</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Where the assets out of which, or the proceeds of which, the interest transferred to the donee spouse may be satisfied include a particular asset or assets with respect to which no deduction would be allowed if such asset or assets were transferred from the donor to such spouse, then the value of the interest transferred to such spouse shall, for purposes of subsection (a), be reduced by the aggregate value of such particular assets.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Joint interests</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the interest is transferred to the donee spouse as sole joint tenant with the donor or as tenant by the entirety, the interest of the donor in the property which exists solely by reason of the possibility that the donor may survive the donee spouse, or that there may occur a severance of the tenancy, shall not be considered for purposes of subsection (b) as an interest retained by the donor in himself.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Life estate with power of appointment in donee spouse</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Where the donor transfers an interest in property, if by such transfer his spouse is entitled for life to all of the income from the entire interest, or all the income from a specific portion thereof, payable annually or at more frequent intervals, with power in the donee spouse to appoint the entire interest, or such specific portion (exercisable in favor of such donee spouse, or of the estate of such donee spouse, or in favor of either, whether or not in each case the power is exercisable in favor of others), and with no power in any other person to appoint any part of such interest, or such portion, to any person other than the donee spouse&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the interest, or such portion, so transferred shall, for purposes of subsection (a) be considered as transferred to the donee spouse, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) no part of the interest, or such portion, so transferred shall, for purposes of subsection (b)(1), be considered as retained in the donor or transferred to any person other than the donee spouse.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">This subsection shall apply only if, by such transfer, such power in the donee spouse to appoint the interest, or such portion, whether exercisable by will or during life, is exercisable by such spouse alone and in all events. For purposes of this subsection, the term &quot;specific portion&quot; only includes a portion determined on a fractional or percentage basis.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) any subsequent transfer by the donor spouse of an interest in such property shall not be treated as a transfer for purposes of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Subparagraph (A) not to apply after transfer by donee spouse</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subparagraph (A) shall not apply with respect to any property after the donee spouse is treated as having transferred such property under section 2519, or such property is includible in the donee spouse's gross estate under section 2044.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Treatment of joint and survivor annuities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a joint and survivor annuity where only the donor spouse and donee spouse <!-- PDFPage:2649 -->have the right to receive payments before the death of the last spouse to die&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this chapter, the term &quot;taxable termination&quot; means the termination (by death, lapse of time, release of power, or otherwise) of an interest in property held in a trust unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) immediately after such termination, a non-skip person has an interest in such property, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) at no time after such termination may a distribution (including distributions on termination) be made from such trust to a skip person.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Certain partial terminations treated as taxable</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, upon the termination of an interest in property held in trust by reason of the death of a lineal descendant of the transferor, a specified portion of the trust's assets are distributed to 1 or more skip persons (or 1 or more trusts for the exclusive benefit of such persons), such termination shall constitute a taxable termination with respect to such portion of the trust property.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Taxable distribution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this chapter, the term &quot;taxable distribution&quot; means any distribution from a trust to a skip person (other than a taxable termination or a direct skip).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Direct skip</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this chapter&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &quot;direct skip&quot; means a transfer subject to a tax imposed by chapter 11 or 12 of an interest in property to a skip person.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Look-thru rules not to apply</h4>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Time and manner of allocation</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Time</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any allocation by an individual of his GST exemption under section 2631(a) may be made at any time on or before the date prescribed for filing the estate tax return for such individual's estate (determined with regard to extensions), regardless of whether such a return is required to be filed.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Manner</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall prescribe by forms or regulations the manner in which any allocation referred to in paragraph (1) is to be made.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:2658 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Deemed allocation to certain lifetime direct skips</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If any individual makes a direct skip during his lifetime, any unused portion of such individual's GST exemption shall be allocated to the property transferred to the extent necessary to make the inclusion ratio for such property zero. If the amount of the direct skip exceeds such unused portion, the entire unused portion shall be allocated to the property transferred.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Unused portion</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1), the unused portion of an individual's GST exemption is that portion of such exemption which has not previously been allocated by such individual (or treated as allocated under paragraph (1) or subsection (c)(1)).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Subsection not to apply in certain cases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An individual may elect to have this subsection not apply to a transfer.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Deemed allocation to certain lifetime transfers to GST trusts</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If any individual makes an indirect skip during such individual's lifetime, any unused portion of such individual's GST exemption shall be allocated to the property transferred to the extent necessary to make the inclusion ratio for such property zero. If the amount of the indirect skip exceeds such unused portion, the entire unused portion shall be allocated to the property transferred.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Unused portion</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1), the unused portion of an individual's GST exemption is that portion of such exemption which has not previously been&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) allocated by such individual,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) treated as allocated under subsection (b) with respect to a direct skip occurring during or before the calendar year in which the indirect skip is made, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) treated as allocated under paragraph (1) with respect to a prior indirect skip.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Definitions</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Indirect skip</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this subsection, the term &quot;indirect skip&quot; means any transfer of property (other than a direct skip) subject to the tax imposed by chapter 12 made to a GST trust.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) GST trust</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &quot;GST trust&quot; means a trust that could have a generation-skipping transfer with respect to the transferor unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the trust instrument provides that more than 25 percent of the trust corpus must be distributed to or may be withdrawn by one or more individuals who are non-skip persons&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) before the date that the individual attains age 46,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) on or before one or more dates specified in the trust instrument that will occur before the date that such individual attains age 46, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) upon the occurrence of an event that, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary, may reasonably be expected to occur before the date that such individual attains age 46,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the trust instrument provides that more than 25 percent of the trust corpus must be distributed to or may be withdrawn by one or more individuals who are non-skip persons and who are living on the date of death of another person identified in the instrument (by name or by class) who is more than 10 years older than such individuals,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the trust instrument provides that, if one or more individuals who are non-skip persons die on or before a date or event described in clause (i) or (ii), more than 25 percent of the trust corpus either must be distributed to the estate or estates of one or more of such individuals or is subject to a general power of appointment exercisable by one or more of such individuals,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) the trust is a trust any portion of which would be included in the gross estate of a non-skip person (other than the transferor) if such person died immediately after the transfer,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) the trust is a charitable lead annuity trust (within the meaning of section 2642(e)(3)(A)) or a charitable remainder annuity trust or a charitable remainder unitrust (within the meaning of section 664(d)), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vi) the trust is a trust with respect to which a deduction was allowed under section 2522 for the amount of an interest in the form of the right to receive annual payments of a fixed percentage of the net fair market value of the trust property (determined yearly) and which is required to pay principal to a non-skip person if such person is alive when the yearly payments for which the deduction was allowed terminate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em" style="padding-left:2em text-indent:0em">For purposes of this subparagraph, the value of transferred property shall not be considered to be includible in the gross estate of a non-skip person or subject to a right of withdrawal by reason of such person holding a right to withdraw so much of such property as does not exceed the amount referred to in section 2503(b) with respect to any transferor, and it shall be assumed that powers of appointment held by non-skip persons will not be exercised.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Automatic allocations to certain GST trusts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, an indirect skip to which section 2642(f) applies shall be deemed to have been made only at the close of the estate tax inclusion period. The fair market value of such transfer shall be the fair market value of the trust property at the close of the estate tax inclusion period.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Applicability and effect</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An individual&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:2659 --><p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) may elect to have this subsection not apply to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) an indirect skip, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) any or all transfers made by such individual to a particular trust, and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) may elect to treat any trust as a GST trust for purposes of this subsection with respect to any or all transfers made by such individual to such trust.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Elections</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Elections with respect to indirect skips</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">An election under subparagraph (A)(i)(I) shall be deemed to be timely if filed on a timely filed gift tax return for the calendar year in which the transfer was made or deemed to have been made pursuant to paragraph (4) or on such later date or dates as may be prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Other elections</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">An election under clause (i)(II) or (ii) of subparagraph (A) may be made on a timely filed gift tax return for the calendar year for which the election is to become effective.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Retroactive allocations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a non-skip person has an interest or a future interest in a trust to which any transfer has been made,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such person&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) is a lineal descendant of a grandparent of the transferor or of a grandparent of the transferor's spouse or former spouse, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) is assigned to a generation below the generation assignment of the transferor, and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) such person predeceases the transferor,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">then the transferor may make an allocation of any of such transferor's unused GST exemption to any previous transfer or transfers to the trust on a chronological basis.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Special rules</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the allocation under paragraph (1) by the transferor is made on a gift tax return filed on or before the date prescribed by section 6075(b) for gifts made within the calendar year within which the non-skip person's death occurred&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the value of such transfer or transfers for purposes of section 2642(a) shall be determined as if such allocation had been made on a timely filed gift tax return for each calendar year within which each transfer was made,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such allocation shall be effective immediately before such death, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the amount of the transferor's unused GST exemption available to be allocated shall be determined immediately before such death.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Future interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, a person has a future interest in a trust if the trust may permit income or corpus to be paid to such person on a date or dates in the future.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Allocation of unused GST exemption</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any portion of an individual's GST exemption which has not been allocated within the time prescribed by subsection (a) shall be deemed to be allocated as follows&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) first, to property which is the subject of a direct skip occurring at such individual's death, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) second, to trusts with respect to which such individual is the transferor and from which a taxable distribution or a taxable termination might occur at or after such individual's death.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Allocation within categories</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The allocation under paragraph (1) shall be made among the properties described in subparagraph (A) thereof and the trusts described in subparagraph (B) thereof, as the case may be, in proportion to the respective amounts (at the time of allocation) of the nonexempt portions of such properties or trusts.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Nonexempt portion</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term &quot;nonexempt portion&quot; means the value (at the time of allocation) of the property or trust, multiplied by the inclusion ratio with respect to such property or trust.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this chapter&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as otherwise provided in this section, the inclusion ratio with respect to any property transferred in a generation-skipping transfer shall be the excess (if any) of 1 over&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) except as provided in subparagraph (B), the applicable fraction determined for the trust from which such transfer is made, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in the case of a direct skip, the applicable fraction determined for such skip.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Applicable fraction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1), the applicable fraction is a fraction&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the numerator of which is the amount of the GST exemption allocated to the trust (or in the case of a direct skip, allocated to the property transferred in such skip), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the denominator of which is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the value of the property transferred to the trust (or involved in the direct skip), reduced by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) any Federal estate tax or State death tax actually recovered from the trust attributable to such property, and</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Severing of trusts</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a trust is severed in a qualified severance, the trusts resulting from such severance shall be treated as separate trusts thereafter for purposes of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Qualified severance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraph (A)&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The term &quot;qualified severance&quot; means the division of a single trust and the creation (by any means available under the governing instrument or under local law) of two or more trusts if&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the terms of the new trusts, in the aggregate, provide for the same succession of interests of beneficiaries as are provided in the original trust.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Trusts with inclusion ratio greater than zero</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If a trust has an inclusion ratio of greater than zero and less than 1, a severance is a qualified severance only if the single trust is divided into two trusts, one of which receives a fractional share of the total value of all trust assets equal to the applicable fraction of the single trust immediately before the severance. In such case, the trust receiving such fractional share shall have an inclusion ratio of zero and the other trust shall have an inclusion ratio of 1.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The term &quot;qualified severance&quot; includes any other severance permitted under regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the value of such property for purposes of subsection (a) shall be its value as finally <!-- PDFPage:2661 -->determined for purposes of chapter 12 (within the meaning of section 2001(f)(2)), or, in the case of an allocation deemed to have been made at the close of an estate tax inclusion period, its value at the time of the close of the estate tax inclusion period, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such allocation shall be effective on and after the date of such transfer, or, in the case of an allocation deemed to have been made at the close of an estate tax inclusion period, on and after the close of such estate tax inclusion period.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Transfers and allocations at or after death</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Transfers at death</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If property is transferred as a result of the death of the transferor, the value of such property for purposes of subsection (a) shall be its value as finally determined for purposes of chapter 11; except that, if the requirements prescribed by the Secretary respecting allocation of post-death changes in value are not met, the value of such property shall be determined as of the time of the distribution concerned.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Allocations to property transferred at death of transferor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any allocation to property transferred as a result of the death of the transferor shall be effective on and after the date of the death of the transferor.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Allocations to inter vivos transfers not made on timely filed gift tax return</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the value of such property for purposes of subsection (a) shall be determined as of the time such allocation is filed with the Secretary, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such allocation shall be effective on and after the date on which such allocation is filed with the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) QTIP trusts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the value of property is included in the estate of a spouse by virtue of section 2044, and if such spouse is treated as the transferor of such property under section 2652(a), the value of such property for purposes of subsection (a) shall be its value for purposes of chapter 11 in the estate of such spouse.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Treatment of certain direct skips which are nontaxable gifts</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a direct skip which is a nontaxable gift, the inclusion ratio shall be zero.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if the trust does not terminate before the individual dies, the assets of such trust will be includible in the gross estate of such individual.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Rules similar to the rules of section 2652(c)(3) shall apply for purposes of subparagraph (A).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) there is a generation-skipping transfer of any property, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) immediately after such transfer such property is held in trust,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">for purposes of applying this chapter (other than section 2651) to subsequent transfers from the portion of such trust attributable to such property, the trust will be treated as if the transferor of such property were assigned to the first generation above the highest generation of any person who has an interest in such trust immediately after the transfer.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Trust retains inclusion ratio</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (2), the provisions of subsection (a) shall not affect the inclusion ratio determined with respect to any trust. Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, notwithstanding the preceding sentence, proper adjustment shall be made to the inclusion ratio with respect to such trust to take into account any tax under this chapter borne by such trust which is imposed by this chapter on the transfer described in subsection (a).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Special rule for pour-over trust</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the generation-skipping transfer referred to in subsection (a) involves the transfer of property from 1 trust to another trust (hereinafter in this paragraph referred to as the &quot;pour-over trust&quot;), the inclusion ratio for the pour-over trust shall be determined by treating the nontax portion of such distribution as if it were a part of a GST exemption allocated to such trust.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Nontax portion</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraph (A), the nontax portion of any distribution is the amount of such distribution multiplied by the applicable fraction which applies to such distribution.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (2), if property is transferred in a generation-skipping <!-- PDFPage:2667 -->transfer, the basis of such property shall be increased (but not above the fair market value of such property) by an amount equal to that portion of the tax imposed by section 2601 with respect to the transfer which is attributable to the excess of the fair market value of such property over its adjusted basis immediately before the transfer. The preceding shall be applied after any basis adjustment under section 1015 with respect to the transfer.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Certain transfers at death</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If property is transferred in a taxable termination which occurs at the same time as and as a result of the death of an individual, the basis of such property shall be adjusted in a manner similar to the manner provided under section 1014(a); except that, if the inclusion ratio with respect to such property is less than 1, any increase or decrease in basis shall be limited by multiplying such increase or decrease (as the case may be) by the inclusion ratio.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Certain trusts treated as separate trusts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this chapter&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the portions of a trust attributable to transfers from different transferors shall be treated as separate trusts, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) substantially separate and independent shares of different beneficiaries in a trust shall be treated as separate trusts.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Except as provided in the preceding sentence, nothing in this chapter shall be construed as authorizing a single trust to be treated as 2 or more trusts. For purposes of this subsection, a trust shall be treated as part of an estate during any period that the trust is so treated under section 645.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Disclaimers</h4>
<p class="note-body-2em"><strong>For provisions relating to the effect of a qualified disclaimer for purposes of this chapter, see section 2518.</strong></p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Limitation on personal liability of trustee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A trustee shall not be personally liable for any increase in the tax imposed by section 2601 which is attributable to the fact that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) section 2642(c) (relating to exemption of certain nontaxable gifts) does not apply to a transfer to the trust which was made during the life of the transferor and for which a gift tax return was not filed, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the inclusion ratio with respect to the trust is greater than the amount of such ratio as computed on the basis of the return on which was made (or was deemed made) an allocation of the GST exemption to property transferred to such trust.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The preceding sentence shall not apply if the trustee has knowledge of facts sufficient reasonably to conclude that a gift tax return was required to be filed or that the inclusion ratio was erroneous.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Valuation rules</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Solely for purposes of determining whether a transfer of an interest in a corporation or partnership to (or for the benefit of) a member of the transferor's family is a gift (and the value of such transfer), the value of any right&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) which is described in subparagraph (A) or (B) of subsection (b)(1), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) which is with respect to any applicable retained interest that is held by the transferor or an applicable family member immediately after the transfer,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">shall be determined under paragraph (3). This paragraph shall not apply to the transfer of any interest for which market quotations are readily available (as of the date of transfer) on an established securities market.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exceptions for marketable retained interests, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Paragraph (1) shall not apply to any right with respect to an applicable retained interest if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) market quotations are readily available (as of the date of the transfer) for such interest on an established securities market,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such interest is of the same class as the transferred interest, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) such interest is proportionally the same as the transferred interest, without regard to nonlapsing differences in voting power (or, for a partnership, nonlapsing differences with respect to management and limitations on liability).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Subparagraph (C) shall not apply to any interest in a partnership if the transferor or an applicable family member has the right to alter the liability of the transferee of the transferred property. Except as provided by the Secretary, any difference described in subparagraph (C) which lapses by reason of any Federal or State law shall be treated as a nonlapsing difference for purposes of such subparagraph.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Valuation of rights to which paragraph (1) applies</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The value of any right described in paragraph (1), other than a distribution right which consists of a right to receive a qualified payment, shall be treated as being zero.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Valuation of certain qualified payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) any applicable retained interest confers a distribution right which consists of the right to a qualified payment, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) there are 1 or more liquidation, put, call, or conversion rights with respect to such interest,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em" style="padding-left:2em text-indent:0em">the value of all such rights shall be determined as if each liquidation, put, call, or conversion right were exercised in the manner resulting in the lowest value being determined for all such rights.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Valuation of qualified payments where no liquidation, etc. rights</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of an applicable retained interest which is described in subparagraph (B)(i) but not subparagraph (B)(ii), the value of the distribution right shall be determined without regard to this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Minimum valuation of junior equity</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a transfer described in paragraph (1) of a junior equity interest in a corporation or partnership, such interest shall in no event be valued at an amount less than the value which would be determined if the total value of all of the junior equity interests in the entity were equal to 10 percent of the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the total value of all of the equity interests in such entity, plus</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the total amount of indebtedness of such entity to the transferor (or an applicable family member).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this paragraph&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Junior equity interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The term &quot;junior equity interest&quot; means common stock or, in the case of a partnership, any partnership interest under which the rights as to income and capital (or, to the extent provided in regulations, the rights as to either income or capital) are junior to the rights of all other classes of equity interests.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Equity interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The term &quot;equity interest&quot; means stock or any interest as a partner, as the case may be.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &quot;applicable retained interest&quot; means any interest in an entity with respect to which there is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a distribution right, but only if, immediately before the transfer described in subsection (a)(1), the transferor and applicable family members hold (after application of subsection (e)(3)) control of the entity, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a liquidation, put, call, or conversion right.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Control</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) in the case of a limited partnership, the holding of any interest as a general partner.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Applicable family member</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this subsection, the term &quot;applicable family member&quot; includes any lineal descendant of any parent of the transferor or the transferor's spouse.</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Treatment of certain rights</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If a right is assumed to be exercised in a particular manner under subsection (a)(3)(B), such right shall be treated as so exercised for purposes of clause (i).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &quot;liquidation, put, call, or conversion right&quot; does not include any right which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) is a right to convert into a fixed number (or a fixed percentage) of shares of the same class of stock in a corporation as the transferred stock in such corporation under subsection (a)(1) (or stock which would be of the same class but for nonlapsing differences in voting power),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) is nonlapsing,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) is subject to proportionate adjustments for splits, combinations, reclassifications, and similar changes in the capital stock, and</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Elections</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">A relationship by legal adoption shall be treated as a relationship by blood.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Certain changes treated as transfers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in regulations, a contribution to capital or a redemption, recapitalization, or other change in the capital structure of a corporation or partnership shall be treated as a transfer of an interest in such entity to which this section applies if the taxpayer or an applicable family member&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) receives an applicable retained interest in such entity pursuant to such transaction, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) under regulations, otherwise holds, immediately after such transaction, an applicable retained interest in such entity.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, if there is any subsequent transfer, or inclusion in the gross estate, of any applicable retained interest which was valued under the rules of subsection (a), appropriate adjustments shall be made for purposes of chapter 11, 12, or 13 to reflect the increase in the amount of any prior taxable gift made by the transferor or decedent by reason of such valuation or to reflect the application of subsection (d).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Treatment as separate interests</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may by regulation provide that any applicable retained interest shall be treated as 2 or more separate interests for purposes of this section.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2702. Special valuation rules in case of transfers of interests in trusts</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Valuation rules</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Solely for purposes of determining whether a transfer of an interest in trust to (or for the benefit of) a member of the transferor's family is a gift (and the value of such transfer), the value of any interest in such trust retained by the transferor or any applicable family member (as defined in section 2701(e)(2)) shall be determined as provided in paragraph (2).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Valuation of retained interests</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The value of any retained interest which is not a qualified interest shall be treated as being zero.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Valuation of qualified interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The value of any retained interest which is a qualified interest shall be determined under section 7520.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Exceptions</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">This subsection shall not apply to any transfer&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) if such transfer is an incomplete gift,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) if such transfer involves the transfer of an interest in trust all the property in which consists of a residence to be used as a personal residence by persons holding term interests in such trust, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) to the extent that regulations provide that such transfer is not inconsistent with the purposes of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Incomplete gift</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term &quot;incomplete gift&quot; means any transfer which would not be treated as a gift whether or not consideration was received for such transfer.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Qualified interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term &quot;qualified interest&quot; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) any interest which consists of the right to receive fixed amounts payable not less frequently than annually,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) any interest which consists of the right to receive amounts which are payable not less frequently than annually and are a fixed percentage of the fair market value of the property in the trust (determined annually), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) any noncontingent remainder interest if all of the other interests in the trust consist of interests described in paragraph (1) or (2).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Certain property treated as held in trust</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The transfer of an interest in property with respect to which there is 1 or more term interests shall be treated as a transfer of an interest in a trust.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Joint purchases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If 2 or more members of the same family acquire interests in any property described in paragraph (1) in the same transaction (or a series of related transactions), the person (or persons) acquiring the term interests in such property shall be treated as having acquired the entire property and then transferred to the other persons the interests acquired by such other persons in the transaction (or series of transactions). Such transfer shall be treated as made in exchange for the consideration (if any) provided by such other persons for the acquisition of their interests in such property.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Term interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &quot;term interest&quot; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a life interest in property, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) an interest in property for a term of years.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Valuation rule for certain term interests</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the nonexercise of rights under a term interest in tangible property would not have a substantial effect on the valuation of the remainder interest in such property&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) subparagraph (A) of subsection (a)(2) shall not apply to such term interest, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the value of such term interest for purposes of applying subsection (a)(1) shall be <!-- PDFPage:2674 -->the amount which the holder of the term interest establishes as the amount for which such interest could be sold to an unrelated third party.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Treatment of transfers of interests in portion of trust</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of a transfer of an income or remainder interest with respect to a specified portion of the property in a trust, only such portion shall be taken into account in applying this section to such transfer.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Member of the family</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term &quot;member of the family&quot; shall have the meaning given such term by section 2704(c)(2).</p>
