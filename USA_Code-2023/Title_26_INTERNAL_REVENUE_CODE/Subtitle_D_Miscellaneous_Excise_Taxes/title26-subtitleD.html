The tax imposed by this subsection shall not apply to the undistributed income of a private foundation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) for any taxable year for which it is an operating foundation (as defined in subsection (j)(3)), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to the extent that the foundation failed to distribute any amount solely because of an incorrect valuation of assets under subsection (e), if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the failure to value the assets properly was not willful and was due to reasonable cause,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such amount is distributed as qualifying distributions (within the meaning of subsection (g)) by the foundation during the allowable distribution period (as defined in subsection (j)(2)),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the foundation notifies the Secretary that such amount has been distributed (within the meaning of subparagraph (B)) to correct such failure, and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:3022 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) such distribution is treated under subsection (h)(2) as made out of the undistributed income for the taxable year for which a tax would (except for this paragraph) have been imposed under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Additional tax</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any case in which an initial tax is imposed under subsection (a) on the undistributed income of a private foundation for any taxable year, if any portion of such income remains undistributed at the close of the taxable period, there is hereby imposed a tax equal to 100 percent of the amount remaining undistributed at such time.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of subsection (d), the minimum investment return for any private foundation for any taxable year is 5 percent of the excess of&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the acquisition indebtedness with respect to such assets (determined under section 514(c)(1) without regard to the taxable year in which the indebtedness was incurred).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Valuation</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of paragraph (1)(A), the fair market value of securities for which market quotations are readily available shall be determined on a monthly basis.

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Reductions in value for blockage or similar factors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In determining the value of any securities under this paragraph, the fair market value of such securities (determined without regard to any reduction in value) shall not be reduced unless, and only to the extent that, the private foundation establishes that as a result of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the size of the block of such securities,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the fact that the securities held are securities in a closely held corporation, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this section, the term &quot;qualifying distribution&quot; shall not include any amount paid by a private foundation which is not an operating foundation to&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">In lieu of the tax imposed by section 4940, there is hereby imposed for each taxable year on the gross investment income (within the meaning of section 4940(c)(2)) derived from sources within the United States (within the meaning of section 861) by every foreign organization which is a private foundation for the taxable year a tax equal to 4 percent of such income.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Certain sections inapplicable</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Section 507 (relating to termination of private foundation status), section 508 (relating to special rules with respect to section 501(c)(3) organizations), and this chapter (other than this section) shall not apply to any foreign organization which has received substantially all of its support (other than gross investment income) from sources outside the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Denial of exemption to foreign organizations engaged in prohibited transactions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A foreign organization described in subsection (b) shall not be exempt from taxation under section 501(a) if it has engaged in a prohibited transaction after December 31, 1969.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Prohibited transactions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, the term &quot;prohibited transaction&quot; means any act or failure to act (other than with respect to section 4942(e)) which would subject a foreign organization described in subsection (b), or a disqualified person (as defined in section 4946) with respect thereto, to liability for a penalty under section 6684 or a tax under section 507 if such foreign organization were a domestic organization.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Taxable years affected</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), a foreign organization described in subsection (b) shall be denied exemption from taxation under section 501(a) by reason of paragraph (1) for all taxable years beginning with the taxable year during which it is notified by the Secretary that it has engaged in a prohibited transaction. The Secretary shall publish such notice in the Federal Register on the day on which he so notifies such foreign organization.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:3039 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, any foreign organization described in subsection (b) which is denied exemption from taxation under section 501(a) by reason of paragraph (1) may, with respect to the second taxable year following the taxable year in which notice is given under subparagraph (A) (or any taxable year thereafter), file claim for exemption from taxation under section 501(a). If the Secretary is satisfied that such organization will not knowingly again engage in a prohibited transaction, such organization shall not, with respect to taxable years beginning with the taxable year with respect to which such claim is filed, be denied exemption from taxation under section 501(a) by reason of any prohibited transaction which was engaged in before the date on which such notice was given under subparagraph (A).</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If any taxable event is corrected during the correction period for such event, then any second tier tax imposed with respect to such event (including interest, additions to the tax, and additional amounts) shall not be assessed, and if assessed the assessment shall be abated, and if collected shall be credited or refunded as an overpayment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Supplemental proceeding</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the determination by a court that the taxpayer is liable for a second tier tax has become final, such court shall have jurisdiction to conduct any necessary supplemental proceeding to determine whether the taxable event was corrected during the correction period. Such a supplemental proceeding may be begun only during the period which ends on the 90th day after the last day of the correction period. Where such a supplemental proceeding has begun, the reference in the second sentence of section 6213(a) to a final decision of the Tax Court shall be treated as including a final decision in such supplemental proceeding.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Suspension of period of collection for second tier tax</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Proceeding in District Court or United States Court of Federal Claims</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, not later than 90 days after the day on which the second tier tax is assessed, the first tier tax is paid in full and a claim for refund of the amount so paid is filed, no levy or proceeding in court for the collection of the second tier tax shall be made, begun, or prosecuted until a final resolution of a proceeding begun as provided in paragraph (2) (and of any supplemental proceeding with respect thereto under subsection (b)). Notwithstanding section 7421(a), the collection by levy or proceeding may be enjoined during the time such prohibition is in force by a proceeding in the proper court.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Suit must be brought to determine liability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, within 90 days after the day on which his claim for refund is denied, the person against whom the second tier tax was assessed fails to begin a proceeding described in section 7422 for the determination of his liability for such tax, paragraph (1) shall cease to apply with respect to such tax, effective on the day following the close of the 90-day period referred to in this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Suspension of running of period of limitations on collection</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The running of the period of limitations provided in section 6502 on the collection by levy or by a proceeding in court with respect to any second tier tax described in paragraph (1) shall be suspended for the period during which the Secretary is prohibited from collecting by levy or a proceeding in court.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Jeopardy collection</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary makes a finding that the collection of the second tier tax is in jeopardy, nothing in this subsection shall prevent the immediate collection of such tax.</p>

<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 94&ndash;455, title VIII, &sect;803(h), Oct. 4, 1976, 90 Stat. 1590, provided that: &quot;The Congress, in a series of laws (the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, the Trade Act of 1974, and the Tax Reduction Act of 1975) and this Act has made clear its interest in encouraging employee stock ownership plans as a bold and innovative method of strengthening the free private enterprise system which will solve the dual problems of securing capital funds for necessary capital growth and of bringing about stock ownership by all corporate employees. The Congress is deeply concerned that the objectives sought by this series of laws will be made unattainable by regulations and rulings which treat employee stock ownership plans as conventional retirement plans, which reduce the freedom of the employee trusts and employers to take the necessary steps to implement the plans, and which otherwise block the establishment and success of these plans. Because of the special purposes for which employee stock ownership plans are established, it is consistent with the intent of Congress to permit these plans (whether structured as pension, stock bonus, or profit-sharing plans) to distribute income on employer securities currently.&quot;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Definitions and special rules</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Qualified plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &quot;qualified plan&quot; means any plan meeting the requirements of section 401(a) or 403(a), other than&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a plan maintained by an employer if such employer has, at all times, been exempt from tax under subtitle A, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a governmental plan (within the meaning of section 414(d)).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Such term shall include any plan which, at any time, has been determined by the Secretary to be a qualified plan.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the annual addition (as determined under section 415(c)) attributable to each such allocation shall not exceed the value of such securities as of the time such securities were credited to such suspense account, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) no additional employer contributions shall be permitted to an employee stock ownership plan described in subparagraph (A) of the employer before the allocation of such amount.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em" style="padding-left:2em text-indent:0em">The amount allocated in the year of transfer shall not be less than the lesser of the maximum amount allowable under section 415 or 1/8 of the amount attributable to the securities acquired. In the case of dividends on securities held in the suspense account, the requirements of this subparagraph are met only if the dividends are allocated to accounts of participants or paid to participants in proportion to their accounts, or used to repay loans used to purchase employer securities.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Participants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The requirements of this subparagraph are met if at least half of the participants in the qualified plan are participants in the employee stock ownership plan (as of the close of the 1st plan year for which an allocation of the securities is required).</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(G) Amount transferred to include income thereon, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The amount transferred shall not be treated as meeting the requirements of subparagraphs (B) and (C) unless amounts attributable to such amount also meet such requirements.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Time for payment of tax</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of subtitle F, the time for payment of the tax imposed by subsection (a) shall be the last day of the month following the month in which the employer reversion occurs.</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Reduction for increase in benefits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The amount determined under this clause is an amount equal to the present value of the aggregate increases in the accrued benefits under the terminated plan of any participants or beneficiaries pursuant to a plan amendment which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) is adopted during the 60-day period ending on the date of termination of the qualified plan, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) takes effect immediately on the termination date.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Treatment of amount transferred</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In the case of the transfer of any amount under clause (i)&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) if any portion of such amount may not be allocated to other participants under subclause (I) by reason of such limitation, such portion shall be treated <!-- PDFPage:3096 -->as an employer reversion to which this section applies.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Coordination with other provisions</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">A benefit may not be increased under paragraph (2)(B)(ii) or (3)(A), and an amount may not be allocated to a participant under paragraph (2)(C), if such increase or allocation would result in a failure to meet any requirement under section 401(a)(4) or 415.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Treatment as employer contributions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any increase in benefits under paragraph (2)(B)(ii) or (3)(A), or any allocation of any amount (or income allocable thereto) to any account under paragraph (2)(C), shall be treated as an annual benefit or annual addition for purposes of section 415.</p>
