<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) such exclusion relates to a condition (whether physical or mental), regardless of the cause of the condition, for which medical advice, diagnosis, care, or treatment was recommended or received within the 6-month period ending on the enrollment date;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) such exclusion extends for a period of not more than 12 months (or 18 months in the case of a late enrollee) after the enrollment date; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the period of any such preexisting condition exclusion is reduced by the length of the aggregate of the periods of creditable coverage (if any) applicable to the participant or beneficiary as of the enrollment date.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this section, genetic information shall not be treated as a condition described in subsection (a)(1) in the absence of a diagnosis of the condition related to such information.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Enrollment date</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &quot;enrollment date&quot; means, with respect to an individual covered under a group health plan, the date of enrollment of the individual in the plan or, if earlier, the first day of the waiting period for such enrollment.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Late enrollee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &quot;late enrollee&quot; means, with respect to coverage under a group health plan, a participant or beneficiary who enrolls under the plan other than during&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Not counting periods before significant breaks in coverage</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A period of creditable coverage shall not be counted, with respect to enrollment of an individual under a group health plan, if, after such period and before the enrollment date, there was a 63-day period during all of which the individual was not covered under any creditable coverage.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Waiting period not treated as a break in coverage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraph (A) and subsection (d)(4), any period that an individual is in a waiting period for any coverage under a group health plan or is in an affiliation period shall not be taken into account in determining the continuous period under subparagraph (A).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as otherwise provided under subparagraph (B), for purposes of applying sub<!-- PDFPage:4171 -->section (a)(3), a group health plan shall count a period of creditable coverage without regard to the specific benefits for which coverage is offered during the period.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Election of alternative method</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A group health plan may elect to apply subsection (a)(3) based on coverage of any benefits within each of several classes or categories of benefits specified in regulations rather than as provided under subparagraph (A).

Under such election a group health plan shall count a period of creditable coverage with respect to any class or category of benefits if any level of benefits is covered within such class or category.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Plan notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of an election with respect to a group health plan under subparagraph (B), the plan shall&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Issuer compliance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">To the extent that medical care under a group health plan consists of health insurance coverage offered in connection with the plan, the plan is deemed to have satisfied the certification requirement under this paragraph if the issuer provides for such certification in accordance with this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Disclosure of information on previous benefits</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) such entity may charge the requesting plan or issuer for the reasonable cost of disclosing such information.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall establish rules to prevent an entity's failure to provide information under paragraph (1) or (2) with respect to previous coverage of an individual from adversely <!-- PDFPage:4172 -->affecting any subsequent coverage of the individual under another group health plan or health insurance coverage.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Special enrollment periods</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Individuals losing other coverage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A group health plan shall permit an employee who is eligible, but not enrolled, for coverage under the terms of the plan (or a dependent of such an employee if the dependent is eligible, but not enrolled, for coverage under such terms) to enroll for coverage under the terms of the plan if each of the following conditions is met:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The employee stated in writing at such time that coverage under a group health plan or health insurance coverage was the reason for declining enrollment, but only if the plan sponsor (or the health insurance issuer offering health insurance coverage in connection with the plan) required such a statement at such time and provided the employee with notice of such requirement (and the consequences of such requirement) at such time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) The employee's or dependent's coverage described in subparagraph (A)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) was under a COBRA continuation provision and the coverage under such provision was exhausted; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) was not under such a provision and either the coverage was terminated as a result of loss of eligibility for the coverage (including as a result of legal separation, divorce, death, termination of employment, or reduction in the number of hours of employment) or employer contributions toward such coverage were terminated.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) Under the terms of the plan, the employee requests such enrollment not later than 30 days after the date of exhaustion of coverage described in subparagraph (C)(i) or termination of coverage or employer contribution described in subparagraph (C)(ii).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) For dependent beneficiaries</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) a group health plan makes coverage available with respect to a dependent of an individual,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the individual is a participant under the plan (or has met any waiting period applicable to becoming a participant under the plan and is eligible to be enrolled under the plan but for a failure to enroll during a previous enrollment period), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) a person becomes such a dependent of the individual through marriage, birth, or adoption or placement for adoption,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em" style="padding-left:2em text-indent:0em">the group health plan shall provide for a dependent special enrollment period described in subparagraph (B) during which the person (or, if not otherwise enrolled, the individual) may be enrolled under the plan as a dependent of the individual, and in the case of the birth or adoption of a child, the spouse of the individual may be enrolled as a dependent of the individual if such spouse is otherwise eligible for coverage.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Dependent special enrollment period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The dependent special enrollment period under this subparagraph shall be a period of not less than 30 days and shall begin on the later of&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) No waiting period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If an individual seeks coverage of a dependent during the first 30 days of such a dependent special enrollment period, the coverage of the dependent shall become effective&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A group health plan shall permit an employee who is eligible, but not enrolled, for coverage under the terms of the plan (or a dependent of such an employee if the dependent is eligible, but not enrolled, for coverage under such terms) to enroll for coverage under the terms of the plan if either of the following conditions is met:</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Termination of Medicaid or CHIP coverage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The employee or dependent is covered under a Medicaid plan under title XIX of the Social Security Act or under a State child health plan under title XXI of such Act and coverage of the employee or dependent under such a plan is terminated as a result of loss of eligibility for such coverage and the employee requests coverage under the group health plan not later than 60 days after the date of termination of such coverage.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Eligibility for employment assistance under Medicaid or CHIP</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The employee or dependent becomes eligible for assistance, with respect to coverage under the group health plan under such Medicaid plan or State child health plan (including under any waiver or demonstration project conducted under or in relation to such a plan), if the employee requests coverage under the group health plan not later than 60 days after the date the employee or dependent is determined to be eligible for such assistance.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">In this section, the term &quot;medically necessary leave of absence&quot; means, with respect to a dependent child described in subsection (b)(2) in connection with a group health plan, a leave of absence of such child from a postsecondary educational institution (including an institution of higher education as defined in section 102 of the Higher Education Act of 1965), or any other change in enrollment of such child at such an institution, that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) commences while such child is suffering from a serious illness or injury;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) is medically necessary; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) causes such child to lose student status for purposes of coverage under the terms of the plan or coverage.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Requirement to continue coverage</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a dependent child described in paragraph (2), a group health plan shall not terminate coverage of such child under such plan due to a medically necessary leave of absence before the date that is the earlier of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the date that is 1 year after the first day of the medically necessary leave of absence; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the date on which such coverage would otherwise terminate under the terms of the plan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Dependent child described</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A dependent child described in this paragraph is, with respect to a group health plan, a beneficiary under the plan who&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is a dependent child, under the terms of the plan, of a participant or beneficiary under the plan; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) was enrolled in the plan, on the basis of being a student at a postsecondary educational institution (as described in subsection (a)), immediately before the first day <!-- PDFPage:4186 -->of the medically necessary leave of absence involved.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Certification by physician</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Paragraph (1) shall apply to a group health plan only if the plan, or the issuer of health insurance coverage offered in connection with the plan, has received written certification by a treating physician of the dependent child which states that the child is suffering from a serious illness or injury and that the leave of absence (or other change of enrollment) described in subsection (a) is medically necessary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A group health plan shall include, with any notice regarding a requirement for certification of student status for coverage under the plan, a description of the terms of this section for continued coverage during medically necessary leaves of absence. Such description shall be in language which is understandable to the typical plan participant.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a dependent child of a participant or beneficiary is in a period of coverage under a group health plan, pursuant to a medically necessary leave of absence of the child described in subsection (b);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the manner in which the participant or beneficiary is covered under the plan changes, whether through a change in health insurance coverage or health insurance issuer, a change between health insurance coverage and self-insured coverage, or otherwise; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the coverage as so changed continues to provide coverage of beneficiaries as dependent children,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">this section shall apply to coverage of the child under the changed coverage for the remainder of the period of the medically necessary leave of absence of the dependent child under the plan in the same manner as it would have applied if the changed coverage had been the previous coverage.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of a participant or beneficiary in a group health plan who receives air ambulance services from a nonparticipating provider (as defined in section 9816(a)(3)(G)) with respect to such plan, if such services would be covered if provided by a participating provider (as defined in such section) with respect to such plan&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the cost-sharing requirement with respect to such services shall be the same requirement that would apply if such services were provided by such a participating provider, and any coinsurance or deductible shall be based on rates that would apply for such services if they were furnished by such a participating provider;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) such cost-sharing amounts shall be counted towards the in-network deductible and in-network out-of-pocket maximum amount under the plan for the plan year (and such in-network deductible shall be applied) with respect to such items and services so furnished in the same manner as if such cost-sharing payments were with respect to items and services furnished by a participating provider; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the group health plan shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) not later than 30 calendar days after the bill for such services is transmitted by such provider, send to the provider, an initial payment or notice of denial of payment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) pay a total plan payment, in accordance with, if applicable, subsection (b)(6), directly to such provider furnishing such services to such participant, beneficiary, or enrollee that is, with application of any initial payment under subparagraph (A), equal to the amount by which the out-of-network rate (as defined in section 9816(a)(3)(K)) for such services and year involved exceeds the cost-sharing amount imposed under the plan for such services (as determined in accordance with paragraphs (1) and (2)).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Determination of out-of-network rates to be paid by health plans; independent dispute resolution process</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Determination through open negotiation</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">With respect to air ambulance services furnished in a year by a nonparticipating provider, with respect to a group health plan, and for which a payment is required to be made by the plan pursuant to subsection (a)(3), the provider or plan may, during the 30-day period beginning on the day the provider receives a payment or a statement of denial of payment from the plan regarding a claim for payment for such service, initiate open negotiations under this paragraph between such provider and plan for purposes of determining, during the open negotiation period, an amount agreed on by such provider, and such plan for payment (including any cost-sharing) for such service. For purposes of this subsection, the open negotiation period, with respect to air ambulance services, is the 30-day period beginning on the date of initiation of the negotiations with respect to such services.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Accessing independent dispute resolution process in case of failed negotiations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of open negotiations pursuant to subparagraph (A), with respect to air ambulance services, that do not result in a determination of an amount of payment for such services by the last day of the open negotiation period described in such subparagraph with respect to such services, the provider or group health plan that was party to such negotiations may, during the 4-day period beginning on the day after such open negotiation period, initiate the independent dispute resolution process under paragraph (2) with respect to such services. The independent dispute resolution process shall be initiated by a party pursuant to the previous sentence by submission to the other party and to the Secretary of a notification (containing such information as specified by the Secretary) and for purposes of this subsection, the date of initiation of such process shall be the date of such submission or such other date specified by the Secretary pursuant to regulations that is not later than the date of receipt of such notification by both the other party and the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Independent dispute resolution process available in case of failed open negotiations</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Establishment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Not later than 1 year after the date of the enactment of this subsection, the Secretary, jointly with the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Secretary of Labor, shall establish by regulation one independent dispute resolution process (referred to in this subsection as the &quot;IDR process&quot;) under which, in the case of air ambulance services with respect to which a provider or group health plan submits a notification under paragraph (1)(B) (in this subsection re<!-- PDFPage:4199 -->ferred to as a &quot;qualified IDR air ambulance services&quot;), a certified IDR entity under paragraph (4) determines, subject to subparagraph (B) and in accordance with the succeeding provisions of this subsection, the amount of payment under the plan for such services furnished by such provider.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Authority to continue negotiations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Under the independent dispute resolution process, in the case that the parties to a determination for qualified IDR air ambulance services agree on a payment amount for such services during such process but before the date on which the entity selected with respect to such determination under paragraph (4) makes such determination under paragraph (5), such amount shall be treated for purposes of section 9816(a)(3)(K)(ii) as the amount agreed to by such parties for such services. In the case of an agreement described in the previous sentence, the independent dispute resolution process shall provide for a method to determine how to allocate between the parties to such determination the payment of the compensation of the entity selected with respect to such determination.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Clarification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A nonparticipating provider may not, with respect to an item or service furnished by such provider, submit a notification under paragraph (1)(B) if such provider is exempt from the requirement under subsection (a) of section 2799B&ndash;2 of the Public Health Service Act with respect to such item or service pursuant to subsection (b) of such section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Treatment of batching of services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The provisions of section 9816(c)(3) shall apply with respect to a notification submitted under this subsection with respect to air ambulance services in the same manner and to the same extent such provisions apply with respect to a notification submitted under section 9816(c) with respect to items and services described in such section.</p>

An entity selected pursuant to the previous sentence to make a determination described in such sentence shall be referred to in this subsection as the &quot;certified IDR entity&quot; with respect to such determination.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) is described in subparagraph (B), and</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Arrangement described</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An arrangement is described in this subparagraph if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) such arrangement is funded solely by an eligible employer and no salary reduction contributions may be made under such arrangement,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) such arrangement provides, after the employee provides proof of coverage, for the payment of, or reimbursement of, an eligible employee for expenses for medical care (as defined in section 213(d)) incurred by the eligible employee or the eligible employee's family members (as determined under the terms of the arrangement), and</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Certain variation permitted</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraph (A)(ii), an arrangement shall not fail to be treated as provided on the same terms to each eligible employee merely because the employee's permitted benefit under such arrangement varies in accordance with the variation in the price of an insurance policy in the relevant individual health insurance market based on&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the age of the eligible employee (and, in the case of an arrangement which covers medical expenses of the eligible employee's family members, the age of such family members), or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">In the case of an individual who is not covered by an arrangement for the entire year, the limitation under subparagraph (B)(iii) for such year shall be an amount which bears the same ratio to the amount which would (but for this clause) be in effect for such individual for such year under subparagraph (B)(iii) as the number of months for which such individual is covered by the arrangement for such year bears to 12.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Inflation adjustment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In the case of any year beginning after 2016, each of the dollar amounts in subparagraph (B)(iii) shall be increased by an amount equal to&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:4208 --><p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) such dollar amount, multiplied by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the cost-of-living adjustment determined under section 1(f)(3) for the calendar year in which the taxable year begins, determined by substituting &quot;calendar year 2015&quot; for &quot;calendar year 2016&quot; in subparagraph (A)(ii) thereof.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-flush2_hang3">&#160;If any dollar amount increased under the preceding sentence is not a multiple of $50, such dollar amount shall be rounded to the next lowest multiple of $50.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Other definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Eligible employee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &quot;eligible employee&quot; means any employee of an eligible employer, except that the terms of the arrangement may exclude from consideration employees described in any clause of section 105(h)(3)(B) (applied by substituting &quot;90 days&quot; for &quot;3 years&quot; in clause (i) thereof).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Eligible employer</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &quot;eligible employer&quot; means an employer that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) is not an applicable large employer as defined in section 4980H(c)(2), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) does not offer a group health plan to any of its employees.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Permitted benefit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &quot;permitted benefit&quot; means, with respect to any eligible employee, the maximum dollar amount of payments and reimbursements which may be made under the terms of the qualified small employer health reimbursement arrangement for the year with respect to such employee.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Notice</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An employer funding a qualified small employer health reimbursement arrangement for any year shall, not later than 90 days before the beginning of such year (or, in the case of an employee who is not eligible to participate in the arrangement as of the beginning of such year, the date on which such employee is first so eligible), provide a written notice to each eligible employee which includes the information described in subparagraph (B).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Contents of notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The notice required under subparagraph (A) shall include each of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) A statement of the amount which would be such eligible employee's permitted benefit under the arrangement for the year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) A statement that the eligible employee should provide the information described in clause (i) to any health insurance exchange to which the employee applies for advance payment of the premium assistance tax credit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) A statement that if the employee is not covered under minimum essential coverage for any month the employee may be subject to tax under section 5000A for such month and reimbursements under the arrangement may be includible in gross income.</p>
