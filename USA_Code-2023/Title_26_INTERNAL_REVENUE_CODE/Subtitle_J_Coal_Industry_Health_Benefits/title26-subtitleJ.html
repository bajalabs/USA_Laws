<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this chapter&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The health benefit premium for any plan year for any assigned operator shall be an amount equal to the product of the per beneficiary premium for the plan year multiplied by the number of eligible beneficiaries assigned to such operator under section 9706.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Per beneficiary premium</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commissioner of Social Security shall calculate a per beneficiary premium for each plan year beginning on or after February 1, 1993, which is equal to the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the amount determined by dividing&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the aggregate amount of payments from the 1950 UMWA Benefit Plan and the 1974 UMWA Benefit Plan for health benefits (less reimbursements but including administrative costs) for the plan year beginning July 1, 1991, for all individuals covered under such plans for such plan year, by</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Adjustments for medicare reductions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, by reason of a reduction in benefits under title XVIII of the Social Security Act, the level of health benefits under the Combined Fund would be reduced, the trustees of the Combined Fund shall increase the per beneficiary premium for the plan year in which the reduction occurs and each subsequent plan year by the amount necessary to maintain the level of health benefits which would have been provided without such reduction.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Death benefit premium</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The death benefit premium for any plan year for any assigned operator shall be equal to the applicable percentage of the amount, actuarially determined, which the Combined Fund will be required to pay during the plan year for death benefits coverage described in section 9703(c).</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Plan years ending on or before September 30, 2006</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For plan years ending on or before September 30, 2006, the unassigned beneficiaries premium for any assigned operator shall be equal to the applicable percentage of the product of the per beneficiary premium for the plan year multiplied by the number of eligible beneficiaries who are not assigned under section 9706 to any person for such plan year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Plan years beginning on or after October 1, 2006</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Premium accounts; adjustments</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Accounts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The trustees of the Combined Fund shall establish and maintain 3 separate accounts for each of the premiums described in subsections (b), (c), and (d).

<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in subparagraph (B), if, for any plan year, there is a shortfall or surplus in any premium account, the premium for the following plan year for each assigned operator shall be proportionately reduced or increased, whichever is applicable, by the amount of such shortfall or surplus. Amounts credited to an account from amounts transferred under section 9705(b) shall not be taken into account in determining whether there is a surplus in the account for purposes of this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to any surplus in the health benefit premium account or the unassigned beneficiaries premium account which is attributable to&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An assigned operator may, within 30 days of receipt of the information under paragraph (1), request review of the assignment.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The 1992 UMWA Benefit Plan shall develop managed care and cost containment rules which shall be applicable to the payment of benefits under this subsection. Application of such rules shall not cause the plan to be treated as failing to meet the requirements of this subsection. Such rules shall preserve freedom of choice while reinforcing managed care network use by allowing a point of service decision as to whether a network medical provider will be used. Major elements of such rules may include, but are not limited to, elements described in paragraph (3).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Major elements of rules</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Elements described in this paragraph are&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) implementing formulary for drugs and subjecting the prescription program to a rigorous review of appropriate use,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) obtaining a unit price discount in exchange for patient volume and preferred provider status with the amount of the potential discount varying by geographic region,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) limiting benefit payments to physicians to the allowable charge under title XVIII of the Social Security Act, while protecting beneficiaries from balance billing by providers,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) utilizing, in the claims payment function &quot;appropriateness of service&quot; protocols under title XVIII of the Social Security Act if more stringent,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) creating mandatory utilization review (UR) procedures, but placing the responsibility to follow such procedures on the physician or hospital, not the beneficiaries,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) selecting the most efficient physicians and state-of-the-art utilization management techniques, including ambulatory care techniques, for medical services delivered by the managed care network, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) utilizing a managed care network provider system, as practiced in the health care industry, at the time medical services are needed (point-of-service) in order to receive maximum benefits available under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Last signatory operators</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The board of trustees of the 1992 UMWA Benefit Plan shall permit any last signatory operator required to maintain an individual employer plan under section 9711 to utilize the managed care and cost containment rules and programs developed under this subsection if the operator elects to do so.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Standards of quality</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any managed care system or cost containment adopted by the board of trustees of the 1992 UMWA Benefit Plan or by a last signatory operator may not be implemented unless it is approved by, and meets the standards of quality adopted by, a medical peer review panel, which has been established&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) by the settlors, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) by the United Mine Workers of America and a last signatory operator or group of operators.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Standards of quality shall include accessibility to medical care, taking into account that accessibility requirements may differ depending on the nature of the medical need.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:4168 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Guarantee of benefits</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">All 1988 last signatory operators shall be responsible for financing the benefits described in subsection (c) by meeting the following requirements in accordance with the contribution requirements established in the 1992 UMWA Benefit Plan:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The payment of a monthly per beneficiary premium by each 1988 last signatory operator for each eligible beneficiary of such operator who is described in subsection (b)(2) and who is receiving benefits under the 1992 UMWA Benefit Plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The provision of a security (in the form of a bond, letter of credit, or cash escrow) in an amount equal to a portion of the projected future cost to the 1992 UMWA Benefit Plan of providing health benefits for eligible and potentially eligible beneficiaries attributable to the 1988 last signatory operator.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) If the amounts transferred under subsection (a)(3) are less than the amounts required to be transferred to the 1992 UMWA Benefit Plan under subsections (h) and (i) of section 402 of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (30 U.S.C. 1232), the payment of an additional backstop premium by each 1988 last signatory operator which is equal to such operator's share of the amounts required to be so transferred but which were not so transferred, determined on the basis of the number of eligible and potentially eligible beneficiaries attributable to the operator.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Adjustments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The 1992 UMWA Benefit Plan shall provide for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) annual adjustments of the per beneficiary premium to cover changes in the cost of providing benefits to eligible beneficiaries, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) adjustments as necessary to the annual backstop premium to reflect changes in the cost of providing benefits to eligible beneficiaries for whom per beneficiary premiums are not paid.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Additional liability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any last signatory operator who is not a 1988 last signatory operator shall pay the monthly per beneficiary premium under paragraph (1)(A) for each eligible beneficiary described in such paragraph attributable to that operator.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Joint and several liability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A 1988 last signatory operator or last signatory operator described in paragraph (3), and any related person to any such operator, shall be jointly and severally liable with such operator for any amount required to be paid by such operator under this section. The provisions of section 9711(c)(2) shall apply to any last signatory operator described in such section (without regard to whether security is provided under such section, a payment is made under section 9704(j), or both) and if security meeting the requirements of section 9711(c)(3) is provided, the common parent described in section 9711(c)(2)(B) shall be exclusively responsible for any liability for premiums under this section which, but for this sentence, would be required to be paid by the last signatory operator or any related person.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Deductibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any premium required by this section shall be deductible without regard to any limitation on deductibility based on the prefunding of health benefits.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) 1988 last signatory operator</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, the term &quot;1988 last signatory operator&quot; means a last signatory operator which is a 1988 agreement operator.</p>
