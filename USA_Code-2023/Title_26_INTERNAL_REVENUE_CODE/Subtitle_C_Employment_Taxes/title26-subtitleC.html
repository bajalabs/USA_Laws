Such term does not include (i) the amount of any payment (including any amount paid by an employer for insurance or annuities, or into a fund, to provide for any such payment) made to, or on behalf of, an employee or any of his dependents under a plan or system established by an employer which makes provision for his employees generally (or for his employees generally and their dependents) or for a class or classes of his employees (or for a class or classes of his employees and their dependents), on account of sickness or accident disability or medical or hospitalization expenses in connection with sickness or accident disability or death, except that this clause does not apply to a payment for group-term life insurance to the extent that such payment is includible in the gross income of the employee, (ii) tips (except as is provided under paragraph (3)), (iii) an amount paid specifically&mdash;either as an advance, as reimbursement or allowance&mdash;for traveling or other bona fide and necessary expenses incurred or reasonably expected to be incurred in the business of the employer provided any such payment is identified by the employer either by a separate payment or by specifically indicating the separate amounts where both wages and expense reimbursement or allowance are combined in a single payment, or (iv) any remuneration which would not (if chapter 21 applied to such remuneration) be treated as wages (as defined in section 3121(a)) by reason of section 3121(a)(5). Such term does not include remuneration for service which is performed by a nonresident alien individual for the period he is temporarily present in the United States as a nonimmigrant under subparagraph (F), (J), (M), or (Q) of section 101(a)(15) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended, and which is performed to carry out the purpose specified in subparagraph (F), (J), (M), or (Q), as the case may be. For the purpose of determining the amount of taxes under sections 3201 and 3221, compensation earned in the service of a local lodge or division of a railway-labor-organization employer shall be disregarded with respect to any calendar month if the amount thereof is less than $25. Compensation for service as a delegate to a national or international convention of a railway labor organization defined as an &quot;employer&quot; in subsection (a) of this section shall be disregarded for purposes of determining the amount of taxes due pursuant to this chapter if the individual rendering such service has not previously rendered service, other than as such a delegate, which may be included in his &quot;years of service&quot; for purposes of the Railroad Retirement Act. Nothing in the regulations prescribed for purposes of chapter 24 (relating to wage withholding) which provides an exclusion from &quot;wages&quot; as used in such chapter shall be construed to require a similar exclusion from &quot;compensation&quot; in regulations prescribed for purposes of this chapter.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Contributions to State unemployment funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The taxpayer may, to the extent provided in this subsection and subsection (c), credit against the tax imposed by section 3301 the amount of contributions paid by him into an unemployment fund maintained during the taxable year under the unemployment compensation law of a State which is certified as provided in section 3304 for the 12-month period ending on October 31 of such year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The credit shall be permitted against the tax for the taxable year only for the amount of contributions paid with respect to such taxable year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The credit against the tax for any taxable year shall be permitted only for contributions <!-- PDFPage:2763 -->paid on or before the last day upon which the taxpayer is required under section 6071 to file a return for such year; except that credit shall be permitted for contributions paid after such last day, but such credit shall not exceed 90 percent of the amount which would have been allowable as credit on account of such contributions had they been paid on or before such last day.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Upon the payment of contributions into the unemployment fund of a State which are required under the unemployment compensation law of that State with respect to remuneration on the basis of which, prior to such payment into the proper fund, the taxpayer erroneously paid an amount as contributions under another unemployment compensation law, the payment into the proper fund shall, for purposes of credit against the tax, be deemed to have been made at the time of the erroneous payment. If, by reason of such other law, the taxpayer was entitled to cease paying contributions with respect to services subject to such other law, the payment into the proper fund shall, for purposes of credit against the tax, be deemed to have been made on the date the return for the taxable year was filed under section 6071.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) In the case of wages paid by the trustee of an estate under title 11 of the United States Code, if the failure to pay contributions on time was without fault by the trustee, paragraph (3) shall be applied by substituting &quot;100 percent&quot; for &quot;90 percent&quot;.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Additional credit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In addition to the credit allowed under subsection (a), a taxpayer may credit against the tax imposed by section 3301 for any taxable year an amount, with respect to the unemployment compensation law of each State certified as provided in section 3303 for the 12-month period ending on October 31 of such year, or with respect to any provisions thereof so certified, equal to the amount, if any, by which the contributions required to be paid by him with respect to the taxable year were less than the contributions such taxpayer would have been required to pay if throughout the taxable year he had been subject under such State law to the highest rate applied thereunder in such 12-month period to any person having individuals in his employ, or to a rate of 5.4 percent, whichever rate is lower.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Limit on total credits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The total credits allowed to a taxpayer under this section shall not exceed 90 percent of the tax against which such credits are allowable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If an advance or advances have been made to the unemployment account of a State under title XII of the Social Security Act, then the total credits (after applying subsections (a) and (b) and paragraph (1) of this subsection) otherwise allowable under this section for the taxable year in the case of a taxpayer subject to the unemployment compensation law of such State shall be reduced&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A)(i) in the case of a taxable year beginning with the second consecutive January 1 as of the beginning of which there is a balance of such advances, by 5 percent of the tax imposed by section 3301 with respect to the wages paid by such taxpayer during such taxable year which are attributable to such State; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) in the case of any succeeding taxable year beginning with a consecutive January 1 as of the beginning of which there is a balance of such advances, by an additional 5 percent, for each such succeeding taxable year, of the tax imposed by section 3301 with respect to the wages paid by such taxpayer during such taxable year which are attributable to such State;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) 2.7 percent multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the wage base under this chapter and the denominator of which is the estimated United States average annual wage in covered employment for the calendar year in which the determination is to be made, exceeds</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Certification by the Secretary of Labor with respect to additional credit allowance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) On October 31 of each calendar year, the Secretary of Labor shall certify to the Secretary of the Treasury the law of each State (certified by the Secretary of Labor as provided in section 3304 for the 12-month period ending on such October 31), with respect to which he finds that reduced rates of contributions were allowable with respect to such 12-month period only in accordance with the provisions of subsection (a).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the Secretary of Labor finds that under the law of a single State (certified by the Secretary of Labor as provided in section 3304) more than one type of fund or account is maintained, and reduced rates of contributions to more than one type of fund or account were allowable with respect to any 12-month period ending on October 31, and one or more of such reduced rates were allowable under conditions not fulfilling the requirements of subsection (a), the Secretary of Labor shall, on such October 31, certify to the Secretary of the Treasury only those provisions of the State law pursuant to which reduced rates of contributions were allowable with respect to such 12-month period under conditions fulfilling the requirements of subsection (a), and shall, in connection therewith, designate the kind of fund or account, as defined in subsection (c), established by the provisions so certified. If the Secretary of Labor finds that a part of any reduced rate of contributions payable under such law or under such provisions is required to be paid into one fund or account and a part into another fund or account, the Secretary of Labor shall make such certification pursuant to this paragraph as he finds will assure the allowance of additional credits only with respect to that part of the reduced rate of contributions which is allowed under provisions which do fulfill the requirements of subsection (a).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary of Labor shall, within 30 days after any State law is submitted to him for such purpose, certify to the State agency his findings with respect to reduced rates of contributions to a type of fund or account, as defined in subsection (c), which are allowable under such State law only in accordance with the provisions of subsection (a). After making such findings, the Secretary of Labor shall not withhold his certification to the Secretary of the Treasury of such State law, or of the provisions thereof with respect to which such findings were made, for any 12-month period ending on October 31 pursuant to paragraph (1) or (2) unless, after reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing to the State agency, the Secretary of Labor finds the State law no longer contains the provisions specified in subsection (a) or the State has, with respect to such 12-month period, failed to comply substantially with any such provision.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Definitions</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) gives security or assurance, satisfactory to the State agency, for the fulfillment of such guaranties, from which account, unless such account is exhausted or terminated, is paid all and only compensation, payable on the basis of services performed for such person (or for one or more of the persons comprising the group), to any such individual whose guaranteed remuneration has not been paid (either pursuant to the guaranty or from the security or assurance provided for the fulfillment of the guaranty), or whose guaranty is not renewed and who is otherwise eligible for compensation under the State law.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &quot;year&quot; means any 12 consecutive calendar months.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &quot;balance&quot;, with respect to a reserve account or a guaranteed employment account, means the amount standing to the credit of the account as of the computation date; except that, if subsequent to January 1, 1940, any moneys have been paid into or credited to such account other than payments thereto by persons having individuals in their employ, such term shall mean the amount in such account as of the computation date less the total of such other moneys paid into or credited to such account subsequent to January 1, 1940.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Computation date</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &quot;computation date&quot; means the date, occurring at least once in each calendar year and within 27 weeks prior to the effective date of new rates of contributions, as of which such rates are computed.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Reduced rate</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Voluntary contributions</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Payments by certain nonprofit organizations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A State may, without being deemed to violate the standards set forth in subsection (a), permit an organization (or a group of organizations) described in section 501(c)(3) which is exempt from income tax under section 501(a) to elect (in lieu of paying contributions) to pay into the State unemployment fund amounts equal to the amounts of compensation attributable under the State law to service performed in the employ of such organization (or group).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Prohibition on noncharging due to employer fault</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A State law shall be treated as meeting the requirements of subsection (a)(1) only if such law provides that an employer's account shall not be relieved of charges relating to a payment from the State unemployment fund if the State agency determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the payment was made because the employer, or an agent of the employer, was at fault for failing to respond timely or adequately to the request of the agency for information relating to the claim for compensation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the employer or agent has established a pattern of failing to respond timely or adequately to such requests.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) State authority to impose stricter standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in paragraph (1) shall limit the authority of a State to provide that an employer's account not be relieved of charges relating to a payment from the State unemployment fund for reasons other than the reasons described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of such paragraph, such as after the first instance of a failure to respond timely or adequately to requests described in paragraph (1)(A).</p>

<p class="note-body">&quot;<cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 202. [Payment of Extended Compensation]</p>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(a) [State Law Requirements] (1) For purposes of section 3304(a)(11) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 [formerly I.R.C. 1954], a State law shall provide the payment of extended compensation shall be made, for any week of unemployment which begins in the individual's eligibility period, to individuals who have exhausted all rights to regular compensation under the State law and who have no rights to regular compensation with respect to such week under such law or any other State unemployment compensation law or to compensation under any other Federal law and are not receiving compensation with respect to such week under the unemployment compensation law of Canada. For purposes of the preceding sentence, an individual shall have exhausted his rights to regular compensation under a State law (A) when no payments of regular compensation can be made under such law because such individual has received all regular compensation available to him based on employment or wages during his base period, or (B) when his rights to such compensation have terminated by reason of the expiration of the benefit year with respect to which such rights existed.</p>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(2) Except where inconsistent with the provisions of this title, the terms and conditions of the State law which apply to claims for regular compensation and to the payment thereof shall apply to claims for extended compensation and to the payment thereof.</p>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(3)(A) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (2), payment of extended compensation under this Act [see Short Title of 1970 Amendment note set out under section 3311 of this title] shall not be made to any individual for any week of unemployment in his eligibility period&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(i) during which he fails to accept any offer of suitable work (as defined in subparagraph (c) [probably means subpar. (C)]) or fails to apply for any suitable work to which he was referred by the State agency; or</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(ii) during which he fails to actively engage in seeking work, unless such individual is not actively engaged in seeking work because such individual is, as determined in accordance with State law&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&quot;(I) before any court of the United States or any State pursuant to a lawfully issued summons to appear for jury duty (as such term may be defined by the Secretary of Labor), or</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&quot;(II) hospitalized for treatment of an emergency or a life-threatening condition (as such term may be defined by such Secretary),</p>
<p class="note-body-block-1em">if such exemptions in clauses (I) and (II) apply to recipients of regular benefits, and the State chooses to apply such exemptions for recipients of extended benefits.</p>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(B) If any individual is ineligible for extended compensation for any week by reason of a failure described in clause (i) or (ii) of subparagraph (A), the individual shall be ineligible to receive extended compensation for any week which begins during a period which&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(i) begins with the week following the week in which such failure occurs, and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(ii) does not end until such individual has been employed during at least 4 weeks which begin after such failure and the total of the remuneration earned by the individual for being so employed is not less than the product of 4 multiplied by the individual's average weekly benefit amount (as determined for purposes of subsection (b)(1)(c) [probably means subsec. (b)(1)(C)]) for his benefit year.</p>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(C) For purposes of this paragraph, the term &apos;suitable work&apos; means, with respect to any individual, any work which is within such individual's capabilities; except that, if the individual furnishes evidence satisfactory to the State agency that such individual's prospects for obtaining work in his customary occupation within a reasonably short period are good, the determination of whether any work is suitable work with respect to such individual shall be made in accordance with the applicable State law.</p>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(D) Extended compensation shall not be denied under clause (i) of subparagraph (A) to any individual for any week by reason of a failure to accept an offer of, or apply for, suitable work&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(i) if the gross average weekly remuneration payable to such individual for the position does not exceed the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&quot;(I) the individual's average weekly benefit amount (as determined for purposes of subsection (b)(1)(C)) for his benefit year, plus</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&quot;(II) the amount (if any) of supplemental unemployment compensation benefits (as defined in section 501(c)(17)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) payable to such individual for such week;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(ii) if the position was not offered to such individual in writing and was not listed with the State employment service;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(iii) if such failure would not result in a denial of compensation under the provisions of the applicable State law to the extent that such provisions are not inconsistent with the provisions of subparagraphs (C) and (E); or</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(iv) if the position pays wages less than the higher of&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&quot;(I) the minimum wage provided by section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 [29 U.S.C. 206(a)(1)], without regard to any exemption; or</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&quot;(II) any applicable State or local minimum wage.</p>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(E) For purposes of this paragraph, an individual shall be treated as actively engaged in seeking work during any week if&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(i) the individual has engaged in a systematic and sustained effort to obtain work during such week, and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(ii) the individual provides tangible evidence to the State agency that he has engaged in such an effort during such week.</p>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(F) For purposes of section 3304(a)(11) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, a State law shall provide for referring applicants for benefits under this Act [see Short Title of 1970 Amendment note set out under section 3311 of this title] to any suitable work to which clauses (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) of subparagraph (D) would not apply.</p>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(4) No provision of State law which terminates a disqualification for voluntarily leaving employment, being discharged for misconduct, or refusing suitable employment shall apply for purposes of determining eligibility for extended compensation unless such termination is based upon employment subsequent to the date of such disqualification.</p>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(5) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (2), an individual shall not be eligible for extended compensation unless, in the base period with respect to which the individual exhausted all rights to regular compensation under the State law, the individual had 20 weeks of full-time insured employment, or the equivalent in insured wages. For purposes of this paragraph, the equivalent in insured wages shall be earnings covered by the State law for compensation purposes which <!-- PDFPage:2803 -->exceed 40 times the individual's most recent weekly benefit amount or 1&#189; times the individual's insured wages in that calendar quarter of the base period in which the individual's insured wages were the highest (or one such quarter if his wages were the same for more than one such quarter). The State shall by law provide which one or more of the foregoing methods of measuring employment and earnings shall be used in that State.</p>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(6) No payment shall be made under this Act [see Short Title of 1970 Amendment note set out under section 3311 of this title] to any State in respect of any extended compensation or sharable regular compensation paid to any individual for any week if, under the rules of paragraphs (3), (4), and (5), extended compensation would not have been payable to such individual for such week.</p>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(7) Paragraphs (3) and (4) shall not apply to weeks of unemployment beginning after March 6, 1993, and before January 1, 1995, and no provision of State law in conformity with such paragraphs shall apply during such period.</p>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(b) [Individual's Compensation Accounts] (1) The State law shall provide that the State will establish, for each eligible individual who files an application therefor, an extended compensation account with respect to such individual's benefit year. The amount established in such account shall be not less than whichever of the following is the least:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(A) 50 per centum of the total amount of regular compensation (including dependents&apos; allowances) payable to him during such benefit year under such law,</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(B) thirteen times his average weekly benefit amount, or</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(C) thirty-nine times his average weekly benefit amount, reduced by the regular compensation paid (or deemed paid) to him during such benefit year under such law;</p>
<p class="note-body-block">except that the amount so determined shall (if the State law so provides) be reduced by the aggregate amount of additional compensation paid (or deemed paid) to him under such law for prior weeks of unemployment in such benefit year which did not begin in an extended benefit period.</p>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(2) For purposes of paragraph (1), an individual's weekly benefit amount for a week is the amount of regular compensation (including dependents&apos; allowances) under the State law payable to such individual for such week for total unemployment.</p>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(3)(A) Effective with respect to weeks beginning in a high unemployment period, paragraph (1) shall be applied by substituting&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(i) &apos;80 per centum&apos; for &apos;50 per centum&apos; in subparagraph (A),</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(ii) &apos;twenty&apos; for &apos;thirteen&apos; in subparagraph (B), and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(iii) &apos;forty-six&apos; for &apos;thirty-nine&apos; in subparagraph (C).</p>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term &apos;high unemployment period&apos; means any period during which an extended benefit period would be in effect if section 203(f)(1)(A)(i) were applied by substituting &apos;8 percent&apos; for &apos;6.5 percent&apos;.</p>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(c) [Cessation of Extended Benefits When Paid Under an Interstate Claim in a State Where Extended Benefit Period Is Not in Effect] (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), payment of extended compensation shall not be made to any individual for any week if&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(A) extended compensation would (but for this subsection) have been payable for such week pursuant to an interstate claim filed in any State under the interstate benefit payment plan, and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(B) an extended benefit period is not in effect for such week in such State.</p>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(2) Paragraph (1) shall not apply with respect to the first 2 weeks for which extended compensation is payable (determined without regard to this subsection) pursuant to an interstate claim filed under the interstate benefit payment plan to the individual from the extended compensation account established for the benefit year.</p>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(3) Section 3304(a)(9)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 shall not apply to any denial of compensation required under this subsection.</p>
<p class="note-body">&quot;<cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 203. [Extended Benefit Period]</p>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(a) [Beginning and Ending] For purposes of this title, in the case of any State, an extended benefit period&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(1) shall begin with the third week after the first week for which there is a State &apos;on&apos; indicator; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(2) shall end with the third week after the first week for which there is a State &apos;off&apos; indicator.</p>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(b) [Special Rules] (1) In the case of any State&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(A) no extended benefit period shall last for a period of less than thirteen consecutive weeks, and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(B) no extended benefit period may begin before the fourteenth week after the close of a prior extended benefit period with respect to such State.</p>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(2) When a determination has been made that an extended benefit period is beginning or ending with respect to a State, the Secretary shall cause notice of such determination to be published in the Federal Register.</p>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(c) [Eligibility Period] For purposes of this title, an individual's eligibility period under the State law shall consist of the weeks in his benefit year which begin in an extended benefit period and, if his benefit year ends within such extended benefit period, any weeks thereafter which begin in such extended benefit period.</p>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(d) [State &apos;On&apos; and &apos;Off&apos; Indicators] For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(1) There is a State &apos;on&apos; indicator for a week if the rate of insured unemployment under the State law for the period consisting of such week and the immediately preceding twelve weeks&mdash;</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(2) There is a State &apos;off&apos; indicator for a week if, for the period consisting of such week and the immediately preceding twelve weeks, either subparagraph (A) or subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1) is not satisfied.</p>
<p class="note-body-block">Effective with respect to compensation for weeks of unemployment beginning after March 30, 1977 (or, if later, the date established pursuant to State law), the State may by law provide that the determination of whether there has been a State &apos;on&apos; or &apos;off&apos; indicator beginning or ending any extended benefit period shall be made under this subsection as if (i) paragraph (1) did not contain subparagraph (A) thereof, and (ii) the figure &apos;5&apos; contained in subparagraph (B) thereof were &apos;6&apos;; except that, notwithstanding any such provision of State law, any week for which there would otherwise be a State &apos;on&apos; indicator shall continue to be such a week and shall not be determined to be a week for which there is a State &apos;off&apos; indicator. Effective with respect to compensation for weeks of unemployment beginning after the date of enactment of the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 [Dec. 17, 2010] (or, if later, the date established pursuant to State law), and ending on or before December 31, 2013, the State may by law provide that the determination of whether there has been a state [State] &apos;on&apos; or &apos;off&apos; indicator beginning or ending any extended benefit period shall be made under this subsection as if the word &apos;two&apos; were &apos;three&apos; in subparagraph (1)(A). For purposes of this subsection, the rate of insured unemployment for any thirteen-week period shall be determined by reference to the average monthly covered employment under the State law for the first four of the most recent six calendar quarters ending before the close of such period.</p>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(e) [Rate of Insured Unemployment; Covered Employment] (1) For purposes of subsection (d), the term &apos;rate of insured unemployment&apos; means the percentage arrived at by dividing&mdash;</p>

<p class="note-body">&quot;(2) Determinations under subsection (d) shall be made by the State agency in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(f) [Alternative Trigger] (1) Effective with respect to compensation for weeks of unemployment beginning after March 6, 1993, the State may by law provide that for purposes of beginning or ending any extended benefit period under this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(A) there is a State &apos;on&apos; indicator for a week if&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&quot;(i) the average rate of total unemployment in such State (seasonally adjusted) for the period consisting of the most recent 3 months for which data for all States are published before the close of such week equals or exceeds 6.5 percent, and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&quot;(ii) the average rate of total unemployment in such State (seasonally adjusted) for the 3-month period referred to in clause (i) equals or exceeds 110 percent of such average rate for either (or both) of the corresponding 3-month periods ending in the 2 preceding calendar years; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(B) there is a State &apos;off&apos; indicator for a week if either the requirements of clause (i) or clause (ii) of subparagraph (A) are not satisfied.</p>
<p class="note-body-block">Notwithstanding the provision of any State law described in this paragraph, any week for which there would otherwise be a State &apos;on&apos; indicator shall continue to be such a week and shall not be determined to be a week for which there is a State &apos;off&apos; indicator.</p>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(2) Effective with respect to compensation for weeks of unemployment beginning after the date of enactment of the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 [Dec. 17, 2010] (or, if later, the date established pursuant to State law), and ending on or before December 31, 2013, the State may by law provide that the determination of whether there has been a state [State] &apos;on&apos; or &apos;off&apos; indicator beginning or ending any extended benefit period shall be made under this subsection as if the word &apos;either&apos; were &apos;any&apos;, the word &apos;both&apos; were &apos;all&apos;, and the figure &apos;2&apos; were &apos;3&apos; in clause (1)(A)(ii).</p>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(3) For purposes of this subsection, determinations of the rate of total unemployment in any State for any period (and of any seasonal adjustment) shall be made by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="note-body">&quot;<cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 204. [Payments to States]</p>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(a) [Amount Payable] (1) There shall be paid to each State an amount equal to one-half of the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(A) the sharable extended compensation, and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(B) the sharable regular compensation,</p>
<p class="note-body-block">paid to individuals under the State law.</p>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(2) No payment shall be made to any State under this subsection in respect of compensation (A) for which the State is entitled to reimbursement under the provisions of any Federal law other than this Act, (B) paid for the first week in an individual's eligibility period for which extended compensation or sharable regular compensation is paid, if the State law of such State provides for payment (at any time or under any circumstances) of regular compensation to an individual for his first week of otherwise compensable unemployment, (C) paid for any week with respect to which such benefits are not payable by reason of section 233(d) [now 233(c)] of the Trade Act of 1974 [19 U.S.C. 2293(c)], or (D) paid to an individual with respect to a week of unemployment to the extent that such amount exceeds the amount of such compensation which would be paid to such individual if such State had a benefit structure which provided that the amount of compensation otherwise payable to any individual for any week shall be rounded (if not a full dollar amount) to the nearest lower full dollar amount.</p>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(3) The amount which, but for this paragraph, would be payable under this subsection to any State in respect of any compensation paid to an individual whose base period wages include wages for services to which section 3306(c)(7) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 applies shall be reduced by an amount which bears the same ratio to the amount which, but for this paragraph, would be payable under this subsection to such State in respect of such compensation as the amount of the base period wages attributable to such services bears to the total amount of the base period wages.</p>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(b) [Sharable Extended Compensation] For purposes of subsection (a)(1)(A), extended compensation paid to an individual for weeks of unemployment in such individual's eligibility period is sharable extended compensation to the extent that the aggregate extended compensation paid to such individual with respect to any benefit year does not exceed the smallest of the amounts referred to in subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) of section 202(b)(1).</p>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(c) [Sharable Regular Compensation] For purposes of subsection (a)(1)(B), regular compensation paid to an individual for a week of unemployment is sharable regular compensation&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(1) if such week is in such individual's eligibility period (determined under section 203(c)), and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(2) to the extent that the sum of such compensation, plus the regular compensation paid (or deemed paid) to him with respect to prior weeks of unemployment in the benefit year, exceeds twenty-six times (and does not exceed thirty-nine, forty-six in any case where section 202(b)(3)(A) applies[,] times) the average weekly benefit amount (including allowances for dependents) for weeks of total unemployment payable to such individual under the State law in such benefit year.</p>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(d) [Payment on Calendar Month Basis] There shall be paid to each State either in advance or by way of reimbursement, as may be determined by the Secretary, such sum as the Secretary estimates the State will be entitled to receive under this title for each calendar month, reduced or increased, as the case may be, by any sum by which the Secretary finds that his estimates for any prior calendar month were greater or less than the amounts which should have been paid to the State. Such estimates may be made upon the basis of such statistical, sampling, or other method as may be agreed upon by the Secretary and the State agency.</p>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(e) [Certification] The Secretary shall from time to time certify to the Secretary of the Treasury for payment to each State the sums payable to such State under this section. The Secretary of the Treasury, prior to audit or settlement by the Government Accountability Office, shall make payment to the State in accordance with such certification, by transfers from the extended unemployment compensation account to the account of such State in the Unemployment Trust Fund.</p>

The permission granted in this subsection shall apply (A) only to the extent that no discrimination is made against such instrumentality, so that if the rate of contribution is uniform upon all other persons subject to such law on account of having individuals in their employ, and upon all employees of such persons, respectively, the contributions required of such instrumentality or the individuals in its employ shall not be at a greater rate than is required of such other persons and such employees, and if the rates are determined separately for different persons or classes of persons having individuals in their employ or for different classes of employees, the determination shall be based solely upon unemployment experience and other factors bearing a direct relation to unemployment risk; (B) only if such State law makes provision for the refund of any contributions required under such law from an instrumentality of the United States or its employees for any year in the event such State is not certified by the Secretary of Labor under section 3304 with respect to such year; and (C) only if such State law makes provision for the payment of unemployment compensation to any employee of any such <!-- PDFPage:2808 -->instrumentality of the United States in the same amount, on the same terms, and subject to the same conditions as unemployment compensation is payable to employees of other employers under the State unemployment compensation law.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) National banks</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing contained in section 5240 of the Revised Statutes, as amended (12 U.S.C. 484), shall prevent any State from requiring any national banking association to render returns and reports relative to the association's employees, their remuneration and services, to the same extent that other persons are required to render like returns and reports under a State law requiring contributions to an unemployment fund. The Comptroller of the Currency shall, upon receipt of a copy of any such return or report of a national banking association from, and upon request of, any duly authorized official, body, or commission of a State, cause an examination of the correctness of such return or report to be made at the time of the next succeeding examination of such association, and shall thereupon transmit to such official, body, or commission a complete statement of his findings respecting the accuracy of such returns or reports.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Federal property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No person shall be relieved from compliance with a State unemployment compensation law on the ground that services were performed on land or premises owned, held, or possessed by the United States, and any State shall have full jurisdiction and power to enforce the provisions of such law to the same extent and with the same effect as though such place were not owned, held, or possessed by the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">[(e) Repealed. Sept. 1, 1954, ch. 1212, &sect;4(c), 68 Stat. 1135]</h4>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) American vessels</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The legislature of any State in which a person maintains the operating office, from which the operations of an American vessel operating on navigable waters within or within and without the United States are ordinarily and regularly supervised, managed, directed and controlled, may require such person and the officers and members of the crew of such vessel to make contributions to its unemployment fund under its State unemployment compensation law approved by the Secretary of Labor under section 3304 and otherwise to comply with its unemployment compensation law with respect to the service performed by an officer or member of the crew on or in connection with such vessel to the same extent and with the same effect as though such service was performed entirely within such State. Such person and the officers and members of the crew of such vessel shall not be required to make contributions, with respect to such service, to the unemployment fund of any other State. The permission granted by this subsection is subject to the condition that such service shall be treated, for purposes of wage credits given employees, like other service subject to such State unemployment compensation law performed for such person in such State, and also subject to the same limitation, with respect to contributions required from such person and from the officers and members of the crew of such vessel, as is imposed by the second sentence (other than clause (B) thereof) of subsection (b) with respect to contributions required from instrumentalities of the United States and from individuals in their employ.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Vessels operated by general agents of United States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The permission granted by subsection (f) shall apply in the same manner and under the same conditions (including the obligation to comply with all requirements of State unemployment compensation laws) to general agents of the Secretary of Transportation with respect to service performed by officers and members of the crew on or in connection with American vessels&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) owned by or bareboat chartered to the United States, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) whose business is conducted by such general agents.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">As to any such vessel, the State permitted to require contributions on account of such service shall be the State to which the general agent would make contributions if the vessel were operated for his own account. Such general agents are designated, for this purpose, instrumentalities of the United States neither wholly nor partially owned by it and shall not be exempt from the tax imposed by section 3301. The permission granted by this subsection is subject to the same conditions and limitations as are imposed in subsection (f), except that clause (B) of the second sentence of subsection (b) shall apply.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Requirement by State of contributions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any State may, as to service performed on account of which contributions are made pursuant to subsection (g)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) require contributions from persons performing such service under its unemployment compensation law or temporary disability insurance law administered in connection therewith, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) require general agents of the Secretary of Transportation to make contributions under such temporary disability insurance law and to make such deductions from wages or remuneration as are required by such unemployment compensation or temporary disability insurance law.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) General agent as legal entity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each general agent of the Secretary of Transportation making contributions pursuant to subsection (g) or (h) shall, for purposes of such subsections, be considered a legal entity in his capacity as an instrumentality of the United States, separate and distinct from his identity as a person employing individuals on his own account.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Denial of credits in certain cases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any person required, pursuant to the permission granted by this section, to make contributions to an unemployment fund under a State unemployment compensation law approved by the Secretary of Labor under section 3304 shall not be entitled to the credits permitted, with respect to the unemployment compensation law of <!-- PDFPage:2809 -->a State, by subsections (a) and (b) of section 3302 against the tax imposed by section 3301 for any taxable year if, on October 31 of such taxable year, the Secretary of Labor certifies to the Secretary of the Treasury his finding, after reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing to the State agency, that the unemployment compensation law of such State is inconsistent with any one or more of the conditions on the basis of which such permission is granted or that, in the application of the State law with respect to the 12-month period ending on such October 31, there has been a substantial failure to comply with any one or more of such conditions. For purposes of section 3310, a finding of the Secretary of Labor under this subsection shall be treated as a finding under section 3304(c).</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Requirement of withholding</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as otherwise provided in this section, every employer making payment of wages shall deduct and withhold upon such wages a tax determined in accordance with tables or computational procedures prescribed by the Secretary. Any tables or procedures prescribed under this paragraph shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) apply with respect to the amount of wages paid during such periods as the Secretary may prescribe, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) be in such form, and provide for such amounts to be deducted and withheld, as the Secretary determines to be most appropriate to carry out the purposes of this chapter and to reflect the provisions of chapter 1 applicable to such periods.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Amount of wages</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of applying tables or procedures prescribed under paragraph (1), the term &quot;the amount of wages&quot; means the amount by which the wages exceed the taxpayer's withholding allowance, prorated to the payroll period.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Percentage method of withholding</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If wages are paid with respect to a period which is not a payroll period, the withholding allowance allowable with respect to each payment of such wages shall be the allowance allowed for a miscellaneous payroll period containing a number of days (including Sundays and holidays) equal to the number of days in the period with respect to which such wages are paid.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In any case in which wages are paid by an employer without regard to any payroll period or other period, the withholding allowance allowable with respect to each payment of such wages shall be the allowance allowed for a miscellaneous payroll period containing a number of days equal to the number of days (including Sundays and holidays) which have elapsed since the date of the last payment of such wages by such employer during the calendar year, or the date of commencement of employment with such employer during such year, or January 1 of such year, whichever is the later.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In any case in which the period, or the time described in paragraph (2), in respect of any wages is less than one week, the Secretary, under regulations prescribed by him, may authorize an employer to compute the tax to be deducted and withheld as if the aggregate of the wages paid to the employee during the calendar week were paid for a weekly payroll period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In determining the amount to be deducted and withheld under this subsection, the wages may, at the election of the employer, be computed to the nearest dollar.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Wage bracket withholding</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) At the election of the employer with respect to any employee, the employer shall deduct and withhold upon the wages paid to such employee a tax (in lieu of the tax required to be deducted and withheld under subsection (a)) determined in accordance with tables prescribed by the Secretary in accordance with paragraph (6).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If wages are paid with respect to a period which is not a payroll period, the amount to be deducted and withheld shall be that applicable in the case of a miscellaneous payroll period containing a number of days (including Sundays and holidays) equal to the number of days in the period with respect to which such wages are paid.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In any case in which wages are paid by an employer without regard to any payroll period or other period, the amount to be deducted and withheld shall be that applicable in the case of a miscellaneous payroll period containing a number of days equal to the number of days (including Sundays and holidays) which have elapsed since the date of the last payment of such wages by such employer during the calendar year, or the date of commencement of employment with such employer during such year, or January 1 of such year, whichever is the later.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In any case in which the period, or the time described in paragraph (3), in respect of any wages is less than one week, the Secretary, under regulations prescribed by him, may authorize an employer to determine the amount to be deducted and withheld under the tables applicable in the case of a weekly payroll period, in which case the aggregate of the wages paid to the employee during the calendar week shall be considered the weekly wages.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) If the wages exceed the highest wage bracket, in determining the amount to be deducted and withheld under this subsection, the wages may, at the election of the employer, be computed to the nearest dollar.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) In the case of wages paid after December 31, 1969, the amount deducted and withheld under paragraph (1) shall be determined in accordance with tables prescribed by the Secretary. In the tables so prescribed, the amounts set forth as amounts of wages and amounts of income tax to be deducted and withheld shall be computed on the basis of the table for an annual payroll period prescribed pursuant to subsection (a).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Tax paid by recipient</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the employer, in violation of the provisions of this chapter, fails to deduct and withhold the tax under this chapter, and thereafter the tax against which such tax may be credited is paid, the tax so required to be deducted and withheld shall not be collected from the employer; but this subsection shall in no case relieve the employer from liability for any penalties or additions to the tax otherwise applicable in respect of such failure to deduct and withhold.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:2836 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Included and excluded wages</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the remuneration paid by an employer to an employee for services performed during one-half or more of any payroll period of not more than 31 consecutive days constitutes wages, all the remuneration paid by such employer to such employee for such period shall be deemed to be wages; but if the remuneration paid by an employer to an employee for services performed during more than one-half of any such payroll period does not constitute wages, then none of the remuneration paid by such employer to such employee for such period shall be deemed to be wages.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Withholding allowance</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Under rules determined by the Secretary, an employee receiving wages shall on any day be entitled to a withholding allowance determined based on&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) whether the employee is an individual for whom a deduction is allowable with respect to another taxpayer under section 151;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if the employee is married, whether the employee's spouse is entitled to an allowance, or would be so entitled if such spouse were an employee receiving wages, under subparagraph (A) or (D), but only if such spouse does not have in effect a withholding allowance certificate claiming such allowance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the number of individuals with respect to whom, on the basis of facts existing at the beginning of such day, there may reasonably be expected to be allowable a credit under section 24 (determined after application of subsection (j) thereof) for the taxable year under subtitle A in respect of which amounts deducted and withheld under this chapter in the calendar year in which such day falls are allowed as a credit;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) any additional amounts to which the employee elects to take into account under subsection (m), but only if the employee's spouse does not have in effect a withholding allowance certificate making such an election;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) the standard deduction allowable to such employee (one-half of such standard deduction in the case of an employee who is married (as determined under section 7703) and whose spouse is an employee receiving wages subject to withholding); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) whether the employee has withholding allowance certificates in effect with respect to more than 1 employer.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Allowance certificates</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) On commencement of employment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">On or before the date of the commencement of employment with an employer, the employee shall furnish the employer with a signed withholding allowance certificate relating to the withholding allowance claimed by the employee, which shall in no event exceed the amount to which the employee is entitled.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Change of status</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If, on any day during the calendar year, an employee's withholding allowance is in excess of the withholding allowance to which the employee would be entitled had the employee submitted a true and accurate withholding allowance certificate to the employer on that day, the employee shall within 10 days thereafter furnish the employer with a new withholding allowance certificate. If, on any day during the calendar year, an employee's withholding allowance is greater than the withholding allowance claimed, the employee may furnish the employer with a new withholding allowance certificate relating to the withholding allowance to which the employee is so entitled, which shall in no event exceed the amount to which the employee is entitled on such day.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Change of status which affects next calendar year</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If on any day during the calendar year the withholding allowance to which the employee will be, or may reasonably be expected to be, entitled at the beginning of the employee's next taxable year under subtitle A is different from the allowance to which the employee is entitled on such day, the employee shall, in such cases and at such times as the Secretary shall by regulations prescribe, furnish the employer with a withholding allowance certificate relating to the withholding allowance which the employee claims with respect to such next taxable year, which shall in no event exceed the withholding allowance to which the employee will be, or may reasonably be expected to be, so entitled.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) When certificate takes effect</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) First certificate furnished</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A withholding allowance certificate furnished the employer in cases in which no previous such certificate is in effect shall take effect as of the beginning of the first payroll period ending, or the first payment of wages made without regard to a payroll period, on or after the date on which such certificate is so furnished.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Furnished to take place of existing certificate</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Except as provided in clauses (ii) and (iii), a withholding allowance certificate furnished to the employer in cases in which a previous such certificate is in effect shall take effect as of the beginning of the 1st payroll period ending (or the 1st payment of wages made without regard to a payroll period) on or after the 30th day after the day on which such certificate is so furnished.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Employer may elect earlier effective date</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">At the election of the employer, a certificate described in clause (i) may be made effective beginning with any payment of wages made on or after the day on which the certificate is so furnished and before the 30th day referred to in clause (i).</p>
<!-- PDFPage:2837 --><h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Change of status which affects next year</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Any certificate furnished pursuant to paragraph (2)(C) shall not take effect, and may not be made effective, with respect to any payment of wages made in the calendar year in which the certificate is furnished.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Period during which certificate remains in effect</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A withholding allowance certificate which takes effect under this subsection, or which on December 31, 1954, was in effect under the corresponding subsection of prior law, shall continue in effect with respect to the employer until another such certificate takes effect under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Form and contents of certificate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Withholding allowance certificates shall be in such form and contain such information as the Secretary may by regulations prescribe.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Exemption of certain nonresident aliens</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1), a nonresident alien individual (other than an individual described in section 3401(a)(6)(A) or (B)&#160;<sup><a href="#3402_1_target" name="3402_1">1</a></sup>&#160;) shall be entitled to only one withholding exemption.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Allowance where certificate with another employer is in effect</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a withholding allowance certificate is in effect with respect to one employer, an employee shall not be entitled under a certificate in effect with any other employer to any withholding allowance which he has claimed under such first certificate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Overlapping pay periods, and payment by agent or fiduciary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a payment of wages is made to an employee by an employer&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) with respect to a payroll period or other period, any part of which is included in a payroll period or other period with respect to which wages are also paid to such employee by such employer, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) without regard to any payroll period or other period, but on or prior to the expiration of a payroll period or other period with respect to which wages are also paid to such employee by such employer, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) with respect to a period beginning in one and ending in another calendar year, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) through an agent, fiduciary, or other person who also has the control, receipt, custody, or disposal of, or pays, the wages payable by another employer to such employee,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the manner of withholding and the amount to be deducted and withheld under this chapter shall be determined in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary under which the withholding allowance allowed to the employee in any calendar year shall approximate the withholding allowance allowable with respect to an annual payroll period.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Alternative methods of computing amount to be withheld</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may, under regulations prescribed by him, authorize&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Withholding on basis of average wages</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An employer&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to determine the amount to be deducted and withheld upon each payment of wages to such employee during such quarter as if the appropriate average of the wages so estimated constituted the actual wages paid, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) to deduct and withhold upon any payment of wages to such employee during such quarter (and, in the case of tips referred to in subsection (k), within 30 days thereafter) such amount as may be necessary to adjust the amount actually deducted and withheld upon the wages of such employee during such quarter to the amount required to be deducted and withheld during such quarter without regard to this subsection.</p>
