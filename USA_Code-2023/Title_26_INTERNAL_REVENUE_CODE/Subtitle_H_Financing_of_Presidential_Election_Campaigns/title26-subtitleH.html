<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2)(A) The eligible candidates of a minor party in a presidential election shall be entitled to payments under section 9006 equal in the aggregate to an amount which bears the same ratio to the amount allowed under paragraph (1) for a major party as the number of popular votes received by the candidate for President of the minor party, as such candidate, in the preceding presidential election bears to the average number of popular votes received by the candidates for President of the major parties in the preceding presidential election.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) If the candidate of one or more political parties (not including a major party) for the office of President was a candidate for such office in the preceding presidential election and received 5 percent or more but less than 25 percent of the total number of popular votes received by all candidates for such office, such candidate and his running mate for the office of Vice President, upon compliance with the provisions of section 9003(a) and (c), shall be treated as eligible candidates entitled to payments under section 9006 in an amount computed as provided in subparagraph (A) by taking into account all the popular votes received by such candidate for the office of President in the preceding presidential election. If eligible candidates of a minor party are entitled to payments under this subparagraph, such entitlement shall be reduced by the amount of the entitlement allowed under subparagraph (A).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The eligible candidates of a minor party or a new party in a presidential election whose candidate for President in such election receives, as such candidate, 5 percent or more of the total number of popular votes cast for the office of President in such election shall be entitled to payments under section 9006 equal in the aggregate to an amount which bears the same ratio to the amount allowed under paragraph (1) for a major party as the number of popular votes received by such candidate in such election bears to the average number of popular votes received in such election by the candidates for President of the major parties. In the case of eligible candidates entitled to payments under paragraph (2), the amount allowable under this paragraph shall be limited to the amount, if any, by which the entitlement under the preceding sentence exceeds the amount of the entitlement under paragraph (2).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Limitations</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Expenditures from personal funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to be eligible to receive any payment under section 9006, the candidate of a major, minor, or new party in an election for the office of President shall certify to the Commission, under penalty of perjury, that such candidate will not knowingly make expenditures from his personal funds, or the personal funds of his immediate family, in connection with his campaign for election to the office of President in excess of, in the aggregate, $50,000. For purposes of this subsection, expenditures from personal funds made by a candidate of a major, minor, or new party for the office of Vice President shall be considered to be expenditures by the candidate of such party for the office of President.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall, as soon as practicable after each presidential election, submit a full report to the Senate and House of Representatives setting forth&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the qualified campaign expenses (shown in such detail as the Commission determines necessary) incurred by the candidates of each political party and their authorized committees;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the amounts certified by it under section 9005 for payment to the eligible candidates of each political party; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the amount of payments, if any, required from such candidates under section 9007, and the reasons for each payment required.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Each report submitted pursuant to this section shall be printed as a Senate document.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Regulations, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission is authorized to prescribe such rules and regulations in accordance with the provisions of subsection (c), to conduct such examinations and audits (in addition to the examinations and audits required by section 9007(a)), to conduct such investigations, and to require the keeping and submission of such books, records, and information, as it deems necessary to carry out the functions and duties imposed on it by this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Review of regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Commission, before prescribing any rule or regulation under subsection (b), shall transmit a statement with respect to such rule or regulation to the Senate and to the House of Representatives, in accordance with the provisions of this subsection. Such statement shall set forth the proposed rule or regulation and shall contain a detailed explanation and justification of such rule or regulation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If either such House does not, through appropriate action, disapprove the proposed rule or regulation set forth in such statement no later than 30 legislative days after receipt of such statement, then the Commission may prescribe such rule or regulation. Whenever a committee of the House of Representatives reports any resolution relating to any such rule or regulation, it is at any time thereafter in order (even though a previous motion to the same effect has been disagreed to) to move to proceed to the consideration of the resolution. The motion is highly privileged and is not debatable. An amendment to the motion is not in order, and it is not in order to move to reconsider the vote by which the motion is agreed to or disagreed to. The Commission may not prescribe any rule or regulation which is disapproved by either such House under this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of this subsection, the term &quot;legislative days&quot; does not include any calendar day on which both Houses of the Congress are not in session.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">To be eligible to receive payments under section 9037, a candidate shall, in writing&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Expense limitation; declaration of intent; minimum contributions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To be eligible to receive payments under section 9037, a candidate shall certify to the Commission that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the candidate and his authorized committees will not incur qualified campaign expenses in excess of the limitations on such expenses under section 9035,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the candidate is seeking nomination by a political party for election to the office of President of the United States,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the candidate has received matching contributions which in the aggregate, exceed $5,000 in contributions from residents of each of at least 20 States, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the aggregate of contributions certified with respect to any person under paragraph (3) does not exceed $250.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Termination of payments</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided by paragraph (2), no payment shall be made to any individual under section 9037&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:4104 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) if such individual ceases to be a candidate as a result of the operation of the last sentence of section 9032(2); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) more than 30 days after the date of the second consecutive primary election in which such individual receives less than 10 percent of the number of votes cast for all candidates of the same party for the same office in such primary election, if such individual permitted or authorized the appearance of his name on the ballot, unless such individual certifies to the Commission that he will not be an active candidate in the primary involved.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Qualified campaign expenses; payments to Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any candidate who is ineligible under paragraph (1) to receive any payments under section 9037 shall be eligible to continue to receive payments under section 9037 to defray qualified campaign expenses incurred before the date upon which such candidate becomes ineligible under paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Calculation of voting percentage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1)(B), if the primary elections involved are held in more than one State on the same date, a candidate shall be treated as receiving that percentage of the votes on such date which he received in the primary election conducted on such date in which he received the greatest percentage vote.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Reestablishment of eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) In any case in which an individual is ineligible to receive payments under section 9037 as a result of the operation of paragraph (1)(A), the Commission may subsequently determine that such individual is a candidate upon a finding that such individual is actively seeking election to the office of President of the United States in more than one State. The Commission shall make such determination without requiring such individual to reestablish his eligibility to receive payments under subsection (a).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1)(B), a candidate whose payments have been terminated under paragraph (1)(B) may again receive payments (including amounts he would have received but for paragraph (1)(B)) if he receives 20 percent or more of the total number of votes cast for candidates of the same party in a primary election held after the date on which the election was held which was the basis for terminating payments to him.</p>
