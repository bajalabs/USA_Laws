<h4 class="note-head">Ex. Ord. No. 14019. Promoting Access to Voting</h4>
<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 14019, Mar. 7, 2021, 86 F.R. 13623, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <i>Purpose</i>. The right to vote is the foundation of American democracy. Free and fair elections that reflect the will of the American people must be protected and defended. But many Americans, especially people of color, confront significant obstacles to exercising that fundamental right. These obstacles include difficulties with voter registration, lack of election information, and barriers to access at polling places. For generations, Black voters and other voters of color have faced discriminatory policies and other obstacles that disproportionally affect their communities. These voters remain more likely to face long lines at the polls and are disproportionately burdened by voter identification laws and limited opportunities to vote by mail. Limited access to language assistance remains a barrier for many voters. People with disabilities continue to face barriers to voting and are denied legally required accommodations in exercising their fundamental rights and the ability to vote privately and independently. Members of our military serving overseas, as well as other American citizens living abroad, also face challenges to exercising their fundamental right to vote.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Constitution and laws of the United States prohibit racial discrimination and protect the right to vote. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 [52 U.S.C. 10301 et seq.] and other Federal statutes implement those protections and assign the Federal Government a key role in remedying disenfranchisement and unequal access to the polls. In passing the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 [52 U.S.C. 20501 et seq.], the Congress found that it is the duty of Federal, State, and local governments to promote the exercise of the fundamental right to vote. Executive departments and agencies (agencies) should partner with State, local, Tribal, and territorial election officials to protect and promote the exercise of the right to vote, eliminate discrimination and other barriers to voting, and expand access to voter registration and accurate election information. It is our duty to ensure that registering to vote and the act of voting be made simple and easy for all those eligible to do so.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec.</cap-smallcap> 2. <i>Policy</i>. It is the policy of my Administration to promote and defend the right to vote for all Americans who are legally entitled to participate in elections. It is the responsibility of the Federal Government to expand access to, and education about, voter registration and election information, and to combat misinformation, in order to enable all eligible Americans to participate in our democracy.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec.</cap-smallcap> 3. <i>Expanding Access to Voter Registration and Election Information</i>. Agencies shall consider ways to expand citizens&apos; opportunities to register to vote and to obtain information about, and participate in, the electoral process.</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) The head of each agency shall evaluate ways in which the agency can, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, promote voter registration and voter participation. This effort shall include consideration of:</p>
<p class="note-body">(i) ways to provide relevant information in the course of activities or services that directly engage with the public&mdash;including through agency materials, websites, online forms, social media platforms, and other points of public access&mdash;about how to register to vote, how to request a vote-by-mail ballot, and how to cast a ballot in upcoming elections;</p>
<p class="note-body">(ii) ways to facilitate seamless transition from agencies&apos; websites directly to State online voter registra<!-- PDFPage:25 -->tion systems or appropriate Federal websites, such as Vote.gov;</p>
<p class="note-body">(iii) ways to provide access to voter registration services and vote-by-mail ballot applications in the course of activities or services that directly engage with the public, including:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(A) distributing voter registration and vote-by-mail ballot application forms, and providing access to applicable State online systems for individuals who can take advantage of those systems;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(B) assisting applicants in completing voter registration and vote-by-mail ballot application forms in a manner consistent with all relevant State laws; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(C) soliciting and facilitating approved, nonpartisan third-party organizations and State officials to provide voter registration services on agency premises;</p>
<p class="note-body">(iv) ways to promote and expand access to multilingual voter registration and election information, and to promote equal participation in the electoral process for all eligible citizens of all backgrounds; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(v) whether, consistent with applicable law, any identity documents issued by the agency to members of the public can be issued in a form that satisfies State voter identification laws.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Within 200 days of the date of this order [Mar. 7, 2021], the head of each agency shall submit to the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy a strategic plan outlining the ways identified under this review that the agency can promote voter registration and voter participation.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) The Administrator of the Office of Electronic Government, Office of Management and Budget, shall, consistent with applicable law, coordinate efforts across agencies to improve or modernize Federal websites and digital services that provide election and voting information to the American people, including ensuring that Federal websites are accessible to individuals with disabilities and people with limited English proficiency. As appropriate, the Administrator of the United States Digital Service may support agencies in implementing the strategic plans directed in subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec.</cap-smallcap> 4. <i>Acceptance of Designation Under the National Voter Registration Act</i>. (a) This order shall supersede section 3 of Executive Order 12926 of September 12, 1994 (Implementation of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993) [52 U.S.C. 20506 note].</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Each agency, if requested by a State to be designated as a voter registration agency pursuant to section 7(a)(3)(B)(ii) of the National Voter Registration Act, shall, to the greatest extent practicable and consistent with applicable law, agree to such designation. If an agency declines to consent to such designation, the head of the agency shall submit to the President a written explanation for the decision.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) The head of each agency shall evaluate where and how the agency provides services that directly engage with the public and, to the greatest extent practicable, formally notify the States in which the agency provides such services that it would agree to designation as a voter registration agency pursuant to section 7(a)(3)(B)(ii) of the National Voter Registration Act [52 U.S.C. 20506(a)(3)(B)(ii)].</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec.</cap-smallcap> 5. <i>Modernizing Vote.gov</i>. The General Services Administration (GSA) shall take steps to modernize and improve the user experience of Vote.gov. In determining how to do so, GSA shall coordinate with the Election Assistance Commission and other agencies as appropriate, and seek the input of affected stakeholders, including election administrators, civil rights and disability rights advocates, Tribal Nations, and nonprofit groups that study best practices for using technology to promote civic engagement.</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) GSA's efforts to modernize and improve Vote.gov shall include:</p>
<p class="note-body">(i) ensuring that Vote.gov complies, at minimum, with sections 504 and 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 [29 U.S.C. 794, 794d];</p>
<p class="note-body">(ii) ensuring that Vote.gov is translated into languages spoken by any of the language groups covered under section 203 of the Voting Rights Act [52 U.S.C. 10503] anywhere in the United States; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(iii) implementing relevant provisions of the 21st Century Integrated Digital Experience Act (Public Law 115&ndash;336) [44 U.S.C. 3501 note].</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Within 200 days of the date of this order, GSA shall submit to the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy a strategic plan outlining the steps to modernize and improve the user experience of Vote.gov.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec.</cap-smallcap> 6. <i>Increasing Opportunities for Employees to Vote</i>. It is a priority of my Administration to ensure that the Federal Government, as the Nation's largest employer, serves as a model employer by encouraging and facilitating Federal employees&apos; civic participation. Accordingly, the Director of the Office of Personnel Management shall take the following actions within 200 days of the date of this order:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) coordinate with the heads of executive agencies, as defined in 5 U.S.C. 105, to provide recommendations to the President, through the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, on strategies to expand the Federal Government's policy of granting employees time off to vote in Federal, State, local, Tribal, and territorial elections. Such recommendations should include efforts to ensure Federal employees have opportunities to participate in early voting.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Coordinate with the heads of executive agencies, as defined in 5 U.S.C. 105, to provide recommendations to the President, through the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, on strategies to better support Federal employees who wish to volunteer to serve as non-partisan poll workers or non-partisan observers, particularly during early or extended voting periods.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec.</cap-smallcap> 7. <i>Ensuring Equal Access for Voters with Disabilities</i>. Within 270 days of the date of this order, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) within the Department of Commerce shall evaluate the steps needed to ensure that the online Federal Voter Registration Form is accessible to people with disabilities. During that period, NIST, in consultation with the Department of Justice, the Election Assistance Commission, and other agencies, as appropriate, shall also analyze barriers to private and independent voting for people with disabilities, including access to voter registration, voting technology, voting by mail, polling locations, and poll worker training. By the end of the 270-day period, NIST shall publish recommendations regarding both the Federal Voter Registration Form and the other barriers it has identified.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec.</cap-smallcap> 8. <i>Ensuring Access to Voting for Active Duty Military and Overseas Citizens</i>. (a) Within 200 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Defense shall establish procedures, consistent with applicable law, to affirmatively offer, on an annual basis, each member of the Armed Forces on active duty the opportunity to register to vote in Federal elections, update voter registration information, or request an absentee ballot.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Within 200 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Defense shall evaluate the feasibility of implementing an online system to facilitate the services described in subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) The Secretary of Defense, in coordination with the Department of State, the Military Postal Service Agency, and the United States Postal Service, shall take all practical steps to establish procedures to enable a comprehensive end-to-end ballot tracking system for all absentee ballots cast by military and other eligible overseas voters under the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act, 52 U.S.C. 20301 <i>et seq</i>. Within 200 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Defense shall submit a report to the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy with a strategic plan for establishing the aforementioned tracking system.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) The head of each agency with overseas employees shall designate an employee to be responsible for coordinating with the Federal Voting Assistance Program, including to promote voter registration and voting services available to the agency's overseas employees.

The educational materials should also notify individuals leaving Federal custody of the restrictions, if any, on their ability to vote under the laws of the State where the individual resides and, if any such restrictions exist, the point at which the individual's rights will be restored under applicable State law.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The Attorney General shall establish procedures, consistent with applicable law, to ensure the United States Marshals Service includes language in intergovernmental agreements and jail contracts to require the jails to provide educational materials related to voter registration and voting, and to facilitate voting by mail, to the extent practicable and appropriate.</p>

<!-- PDFPage:35 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Promotion and expansion of use of Federal write-in absentee ballots</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Not later than December 31, 2011, the Presidential designee shall adopt procedures to promote and expand the use of the Federal write-in absentee ballot as a back-up measure to vote in elections for Federal office.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Use of technology</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Under such procedures, the Presidential designee shall utilize technology to implement a system under which the absent uniformed services voter or overseas voter may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) enter the address of the voter or other information relevant in the appropriate jurisdiction of the State, and the system will generate a list of all candidates in the election for Federal office in that jurisdiction; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) submit the marked Federal write-in absentee ballot by printing the ballot (including complete instructions for submitting the marked Federal write-in absentee ballot to the appropriate State election official and the mailing address of the single State office designated under section 20302(b) of this title).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Authorization of appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">There are authorized to be appropriated to the Presidential designee such sums as may be necessary to carry out this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Submission and processing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, a Federal write-in absentee ballot shall be submitted and processed in the manner provided by law for absentee ballots in the State involved. A Federal write-in absentee ballot of an absent uniformed services voter or overseas voter shall not be counted&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in the case of a ballot submitted by an overseas voter who is not an absent uniformed services voter, if the ballot is submitted from any location in the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if the application of the absent uniformed services voter or overseas voter for a State absentee ballot is received by the appropriate State election official after the later of&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) In completing the ballot, the absent uniformed services voter or overseas voter may designate a candidate by writing in the name of the candidate or by writing in the name of a political party (in which case the ballot shall be counted for the candidate of that political party).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) In the case of the offices of President and Vice President, a vote for a named candidate or a vote by writing in the name of a political party shall be counted as a vote for the electors supporting the candidate involved.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Any abbreviation, misspelling, or other minor variation in the form of the name of a candidate or a political party shall be disregarded in determining the validity of the ballot, if the intention of the voter can be ascertained.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">An absent uniformed services voter or overseas voter who submits a Federal write-in absentee ballot and later receives a State absentee ballot, may submit the State absentee ballot. The Presidential designee shall assure that the instructions for each Federal write-in absentee ballot clearly state that an absent uniformed services voter or overseas voter who submits a Federal write-in absentee ballot and later receives and submits a State absentee ballot should make every reasonable effort to inform the appropriate State election official that the voter has submitted more than one ballot.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Use of approved State absentee ballot in place of Federal write-in absentee ballot</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Federal write-in absentee ballot shall not be valid for use in a general, special, primary, or runoff election for Federal office if the State involved provides a State absentee ballot that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) at the request of the State, is approved by the Presidential designee for use in place of the Federal write-in absentee ballot; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) is made available to absent uniformed services voters and overseas voters at least 60 days before the deadline for receipt of the State ballot under State law.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Prohibiting refusal to accept ballot for failure to meet certain requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A State shall not refuse to accept and process any otherwise valid Federal write-in absentee ballot submitted in any manner by an absent uniformed services voter or overseas voter solely on the basis of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Notarization requirements.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Restrictions on paper type, including weight and size.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Restrictions on envelope type, including weight and size.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Certain States exempted</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a State absentee ballot is required to be available to any voter described in section 20310(5)(A) of this title at least 90 days before the general, special, primary, or runoff election for Federal office involved; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a State absentee ballot is required to be available to any voter described in section 20310(5)(B) or (C) of this title, as soon as the official list of candidates in the general, special, primary, or runoff election for Federal office is complete.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) A registrant who has moved from an address in the area covered by one polling place to an address in an area covered by a second polling place within the same registrar's jurisdiction and the same congressional district and who has failed to notify the registrar of the change of address prior to the date of an election, at the option of the registrant&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Change of voting address within a jurisdiction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of a change of address, for voting purposes, of a registrant to another address within the same registrar's jurisdiction, the registrar shall correct the voting registration list accordingly, and the registrant's name may not be removed from the official list of eligible voters by reason of such a change of address except as provided in subsection (d).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Conviction in Federal court</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) On the conviction of a person of a felony in a district court of the United States, the United States attorney shall give written notice of the conviction to the chief State election official designated under section 20509 of this title of the State of the person's residence.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The records maintained pursuant to paragraph (1) shall include lists of the names and addresses of all persons to whom notices described in subsection (d)(2) are sent, and information concerning whether or not each such person has responded to the notice as of the date that inspection of the records is made.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Error rates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The error rate of the voting system in counting ballots (determined by taking into account only those errors which are attributable to the voting system and not attributable to an act of the voter) shall comply with the error rate standards established under section 3.2.1 of the voting systems standards issued by the Federal Election Commission which are in effect on October 29, 2002.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) to make available any materials to the voter (such as notices, instructions, forms, or paper ballots).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Construction</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit a State or jurisdiction which used a particular type of voting system in the elections for Federal office held in November 2000 from using the same type of system after the effective date of this section, so long as the system meets or is modified to meet the requirements of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Protection of paper ballot voting systems</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of subsection (a)(1)(A)(i), the term &quot;verify&quot; may not be defined in a manner that makes it impossible for a paper ballot voting system to meet the requirements of such subsection or to be modified to meet such requirements.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Effective date</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5)(A) At the time that an individual casts a provisional ballot, the appropriate State or local election official shall give the individual written information that states that any individual who casts a provisional ballot will be able to ascertain under the system established under subparagraph (B) whether the vote was counted, and, if the vote was not counted, the reason that the vote was not counted.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The appropriate State or local election official shall establish a free access system (such as a toll-free telephone number or an Internet website) that any individual who <!-- PDFPage:79 -->casts a provisional ballot may access to discover whether the vote of that individual was counted, and, if the vote was not counted, the reason that the vote was not counted.</p>
