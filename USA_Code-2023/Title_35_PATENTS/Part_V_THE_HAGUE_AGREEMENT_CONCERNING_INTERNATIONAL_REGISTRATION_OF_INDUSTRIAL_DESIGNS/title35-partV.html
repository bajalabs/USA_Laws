<h4 class="note-head">Prior Provisions</h4>
<p class="note-body">A prior chapter 38, as added by Pub. L. 96&ndash;517, &sect;6(a), Dec. 12, 1980, 94 Stat. 3018, was originally editorially inserted after chapter 17 of this title because the probable intent of Congress was to designate the chapter as &quot;18&quot;, in view of the numerical designation of the sections contained in the chapter as sections 200 to 211 and in view of the subject matter of the chapter in relation to the subject matter of Part II of this title. Pub. L. 97&ndash;256, title I, &sect;101(5), Sept. 8, 1982, 96 Stat. 816, redesignated chapter 38 as chapter 18 and transferred chapter 18, as so redesignated, from the end of this part to the end of Part II. See 1982 Amendment note set out under the analysis of chapter 18 (&sect;200 et seq.) of this title.</p>
