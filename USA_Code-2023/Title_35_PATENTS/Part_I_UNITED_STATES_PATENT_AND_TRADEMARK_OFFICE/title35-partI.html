<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on Title 35, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;1 (R.S. 475 and Executive Order 4175, Mar. 17, 1925).</p>
<p class="note-body">The word &quot;all&quot; is omitted from the corresponding section of the existing statute and &quot;except as otherwise provided by law&quot; added, since some old records are kept in the National Archives, see 44 U.S.C., 1946 ed., ch. 8A.</p>
<p class="note-body">The word &quot;models&quot; has been omitted to remove emphasis on models since they are no longer generally required. They are included by the word &quot;things.&quot;</p>
<p class="note-body">The phrase &quot;and to trade-mark registrations&quot; is added. There is no enactment corresponding to this section in the trade-mark law. The original chapter of the Revised Statutes containing this section deals with the Patent Office as such in its administration of trade-marks as well as patents. This is explicitly brought out in some of the corresponding sections of the present chapter. Changes in language are made.</p>

<p class="note-body">Based on Title 35, U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;2 (R.S. 476, amended (1) Feb. 15, 1916, ch. 22, &sect;1, 39 Stat. 8, (2) Feb. 14, 1927, ch. 139, &sect;1, 44 Stat. 1098, (3) Apr. 11, 1930, ch. 132, &sect;1, 46 Stat. 155).</p>
<p class="note-body">The temporary designation of the assistant commissioner as Commissioner in case of a vacancy in office is added. This will eliminate complications since present applicable general statutes (5 U.S.C., 1946 ed., &sect;7) permit a vacancy to be temporarily filled only for not more than 30 days.</p>
<p class="note-body">Changes in language are made. &quot;Assistant commissioners&quot; is used in the second sentence (and elsewhere in the bill) as referring to all three assistants.</p>
<p class="note-body">This entire title is subject to Reorganization Plan No. 5 of 1950 (64 Stat. 1263) which vests all functions of the Patent Office in the Secretary of Commerce and authorizes delegation by him. It has been found impractical to so word the various sections of the title, and a general provision has been inserted as the second paragraph of this section of the bill, leaving the wording of various sections of the title in terms of officers previously specified and to whom the functions presently stand delegated.</p>
