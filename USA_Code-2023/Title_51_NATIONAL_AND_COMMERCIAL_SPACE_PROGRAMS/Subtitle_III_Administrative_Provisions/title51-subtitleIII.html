<h4 class="note-head">One Small Step to Protect Human Heritage in Space</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 116&ndash;275, Dec. 31, 2020, 134 Stat. 3358, provided that:</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&quot;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&quot;This Act may be cited as the &apos;One Small Step to Protect Human Heritage in Space Act&apos;.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&quot;SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(a) Findings.&mdash;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(1) On July 16, 1969, the Apollo 11 spacecraft launched from the John F. Kennedy Space Center carrying Neil A. Armstrong, Edwin E. &apos;Buzz&apos; Aldrin, Jr., and Michael Collins.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(2) July 20, 2019, marked the 50th anniversary of the date on which the Apollo 11 spacecraft landed on the Moon and Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first humans to set foot on a celestial body off the Earth.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(3) The landing of the Apollo 11 spacecraft and humanity's first off-world footprints are achievements unparalleled in history, a direct product of the work and perseverance of the more than 400,000 individuals who contributed to the development of the Apollo missions on the shoulders of centuries of science and engineering pioneers from all corners of the world.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(4) Among the thousands of individuals who have contributed to the achievements of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (in this section referred to as &apos;NASA&apos;) are African-American women such as Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughn, Mary Jackson, and Dr. Christine Darden, who made critical contributions to NASA space programs. Katherine Johnson worked at NASA for 35 years and calculated the trajectory of the Apollo 11 landing and the trajectories for the spaceflights of astronauts Alan Shepard and John Glenn. Katherine Johnson, together with many other individuals the work of whom often went unacknowledged, helped broaden the scope of space travel and charted new frontiers for humanity's exploration of space.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(5) The landing of the Apollo 11 spacecraft was made on behalf of all humankind, and Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin were accompanied by messages of peace from the leaders of more than 70 countries.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(6) The lunar landing sites of the Apollo 11 spacecraft, the robotic spacecraft that preceded the Apollo 11 mission, and the crewed and robotic spacecraft that followed, are of outstanding universal value to humanity.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(7) Such landing sites&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&quot;(A) are the first archaeological sites with human activity that are not on Earth;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&quot;(B) provide evidence of the first achievements of humankind in the realm of space travel and exploration; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&quot;(C) contain artifacts and other evidence of human exploration activities that remain a potential source of cultural, historical, archaeological, anthropological, scientific, and engineering knowledge.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(8) On July 20, 2011, NASA published the voluntary guidance entitled &apos;NASA's Recommendations to Space-Faring Entities: How to Protect and Preserve the Historic and Scientific Value of U.S. Government Lunar Artifacts&apos;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(9) In March 2018, the Office of Science and Technology Policy published a report entitled &apos;Protecting &amp; Preserving Apollo Program Lunar Landing Sites &amp; Artifacts&apos;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(10) Article one of the &apos;Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies,&apos; commonly known as the &apos;Outer Space Treaty,&apos; states &apos;[o]uter space, including the moon and other celestial bodies, shall be free for exploration and use by all States without discrimination of any kind, on a basis of equality and in accordance with international law, and there shall be free access to all areas of celestial bodies.&apos;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(11) Article eight of the Outer Space Treaty states, &apos;[a] State Party to the Treaty on whose registry an object launched into outer space is carried shall retain jurisdiction and control over such object, and over any personnel thereof, while in outer space or on a celestial body. Ownership of objects launched into outer space, including objects landed or constructed on a celestial body, and of their component parts, is not affected by their presence in outer space or on a celestial body or by their return to the Earth.&apos;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(12) Article nine of the Outer Space Treaty states, &apos;[i]n the exploration and use of outer space, including the moon and other celestial bodies, States Parties to the Treaty shall be guided by the principle of co-operation and mutual assistance and shall conduct all their activities in outer space, including the moon and other celestial bodies, with due regard to the corresponding interests of all other States Parties to the Treaty,&apos; and continues, &apos;[i]f a State Party to the Treaty has reason to believe that an activity or experiment planned by it or its nationals in outer space, including the moon and other celestial bodies, would cause potentially harmful interference with activities of other States Parties in the peaceful exploration and use of outer space, including the moon and other celestial bodies, it shall undertake appropriate international consultations before proceeding with any such activity or experiment. A State Party to the Treaty which has reason to believe that an activity or experiment planned by another State Party in outer space, including the moon and other celestial bodies, would cause potentially harmful interference with activities in the peaceful exploration and use of outer space, including the moon and other celestial bodies, may request consultation concerning the activity or experiment.</p>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(b) <cap-smallcap>Sense of Congress</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the sense of Congress that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(1) as commercial enterprises and more countries acquire the ability to land on the Moon, it is necessary to encourage the development of best practices to respect the principle of due regard and to limit harmful interference to the Apollo landing site artifacts in acknowledgment of the human effort and innovation they represent, as well as their archaeological, anthropological, historical, scientific, and engineering significance and value; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(2) the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration should continue to develop best practices to respect the principle of due regard <!-- PDFPage:66 -->and limit harmful interference with historic Apollo lunar landing site artifacts.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&quot;SEC. 3. BEST PRACTICES RELATED TO APOLLO HISTORIC LUNAR LANDING SITE ARTIFACTS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(a) <cap-smallcap>In General</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration shall&mdash;</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(2) inform other relevant Federal agencies of the recommendations described in subsection (b); and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(3) encourage the use of best practices, consistent with the recommendations in subsection (b), by other relevant Federal agencies.</p>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(b) <cap-smallcap>Recommendations Described</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The recommendations described in this subsection are&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(1) &apos;NASA's Recommendations to Space-Faring Entities: How to Protect and Preserve the Historic and Scientific Value of U.S. Government Lunar Artifacts&apos; issued by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration on July 20, 2011, and updated on October 28, 2011; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(2) any successor recommendations, guidelines, best practices, or standards relating to the principle of due regard and the limitation of harmful interference with Apollo landing site artifacts issued by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.</p>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(c) <cap-smallcap>Exemption</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator may waive the conditions or requirements from subsection (a)(1) as it applies to an individual contract, grant, agreement, partnership or other arrangement pertaining to lunar activities carried out by, for, or in partnership with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration so long as&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(1) such waiver is accompanied by a finding from the Administrator that carrying out the obligation of subsection (a)(1) would be unduly prohibitive to an activity or activities of legitimate and significant historical, archaeological, anthropological, scientific, or engineering value; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(2) the finding in paragraph (1) is provided to the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate not later than 30 days prior to the waiver taking effect.&quot;</p>

<p class="note-body">My Administration is committed to implementing a bold, new approach to human spaceflight. Supported by a $6 billion increase to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) budget over the next 5 years, this strategy will foster the development of path-breaking technologies, increase the reach and reduce the cost of human and robotic exploration of space, and help create thousands of new jobs.</p>
<p class="note-body">NASA's budget also includes $429 million next year, and $1.9 billion over the next 5 years, to modernize the Kennedy Space Center and other nearby space launch facilities in Florida. This modernization effort will help spur new commercial business and innovation and provide additional good jobs to the region. While all of the new aspects of my Administration's plan together will create thousands of new jobs in Florida, past decisions to end the Space Shuttle program will still affect families and communities along Florida's &quot;Space Coast.&quot;</p>
<p class="note-body">Building on this significant new investment at the Kennedy Space Center and my increased budget for NASA overall, I am committed to taking additional steps to help local economies like Florida's Space Coast adapt and thrive in the years ahead. The men and women who work in Florida's aerospace industry are some of the most talented and highly trained in the Nation. It is critical that their skills are tapped as we transform and expand the country's space exploration efforts. That is why I am launching a $40 million, multi-agency initiative to help the Space Coast transform their economies and prepare their workers for the opportunities of tomorrow. This effort will build on and complement ongoing local and Federal economic and workforce-development efforts through a Task Force composed of senior-level Administration officials from relevant agencies that will construct an economic development action plan by August 15, 2010.</p>
<p class="note-body">To these ends, I hereby direct the following:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <i>Establishment of the Task Force on Space Industry Workforce and Economic Development</i>. There is established a Task Force on Space Industry Workforce and Economic Development (Task Force) to develop, in collaboration with local stakeholders, an interagency action plan to facilitate economic development strategies and plans along the Space Coast and to provide training and other opportunities for affected aerospace workers so they are equipped to contribute to new developments in America's space program and related industries. The Secretary of Commerce and the Administrator of NASA shall serve as Co-Chairs of the Task Force.</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) <i>Membership of the Task Force</i>. In addition to the Co-Chairs, the Task Force shall consist of the following members:</p>

<p class="note-body">(d) identifies areas of collaboration with other public or nongovernmental actors to achieve the objectives of the Task Force; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) details a coordinated implementation strategy by executive departments and agencies to meet the objectives of the Task Force.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. <i>Termination</i>. The Task Force shall terminate 3 years after the date of this memorandum unless extended by the President.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 6. <i>General Provisions</i>.

The Administrator may also prescribe regulations, as the Administrator considers appropriate in the interest of safety, security, and national security, for the conduct of periodic recurring testing of such employees for such use in violation of applicable law or Federal regulation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Suspension, disqualification, or dismissal</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In prescribing regulations under the programs required by this subsection, the Administrator shall require, as the Administrator considers appropriate, the suspension, disqualification, or dismissal of any employee to which paragraph (1) or (2) applies, in accordance with the provisions of this section, in any instance where a test conducted and confirmed under this section indicates that such employee has used, in violation of applicable law or Federal regulation, alcohol or a controlled substance.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) provide that each specimen sample be subdivided, secured, and labelled in the presence of the tested individual and that a portion thereof be retained in a secure manner to prevent the possibility of tampering, so that in the event the individual's confirmation test results are positive the individual has an opportunity to have the retained portion assayed by a confirmation test done independently at a second certified laboratory if the individual requests the independent test within 3 days after being advised of the results of the initial confirmation test;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) ensure appropriate safeguards for testing to detect and quantify alcohol in breath and body fluid samples, including urine and blood, through the development of regulations as may be necessary and in consultation with the Department of Health and Human Services;</p>
