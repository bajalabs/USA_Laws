<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Policy</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Congress declares that a priority goal of constructing the International Space Station is the economic development of Earth orbital space. Congress further declares that free and competitive markets create the most efficient conditions for promoting economic development, and should therefore govern the economic development of Earth orbital space. Congress further declares that the use of free market principles in operating, servicing, allocating the use of, and adding capabilities to the Space Station, and the resulting fullest possible engagement of commercial providers and participation of commercial users, will reduce Space Station operational costs for all partners and the Federal Government's share of the United States burden to fund operations.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Congressional intent</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the intent of Congress that funding for the program described in paragraph (1)(D) shall not come at the expense of full funding of the amounts authorized under section 101(3)(A) of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2008 (Public Law 110&ndash;422, 122 Stat. 4783), and for future fiscal years, for Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle development, Ares I Crew Launch Vehicle development, or International Space Station cargo delivery.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Additional technologies</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administration shall make International Space Station-compatible docking adaptors and other relevant technologies available to the commercial crew providers selected to service the International Space Station.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Crew transfer and crew rescue services contract</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If a commercial provider demonstrates the capability to provide International Space Station crew transfer and crew rescue services and to satisfy Administration ascent, entry, and International Space Station proximity operations safety requirements, the Administration shall enter into an International Space Station crew transfer and crew rescue services contract with that commercial provider for a portion of the Administration's anticipated International Space Station crew transfer and crew rescue requirements from the time the commercial provider commences operations under contract with the Administration through calendar year 2016, with an option to extend the period of performance through calendar year 2020.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 107&ndash;248, title IX, &sect;902, Oct. 23, 2002, 116 Stat. 1573, provided that: &quot;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(1) It is in the national interest to encourage the production of cost-effective, in-space transportation systems, which would be built and operated by the private sector on a commercial basis.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(2) The use of reusable in-space transportation systems will enhance performance levels of in-space operations, enhance efficient and safe disposal of satellites at the end of their useful lives, and increase the capability and reliability of existing ground-to-space launch vehicles.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(3) Commercial reusable in-space transportation systems will enhance the economic well-being and national security of the United States by reducing space operations costs for commercial and national space programs and by adding new space capabilities to space operations.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(4) Commercial reusable in-space transportation systems will provide new cost-effective space capabilities (including orbital transfers from low altitude orbits to high altitude orbits and return, the correction of erroneous satellite orbits, and the recovery, refurbishment, and refueling of satellites) and the provision of upper stage functions to increase ground-to-orbit launch vehicle payloads to geostationary and other high energy orbits.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(5) Commercial reusable in-space transportation systems can enhance and enable the space exploration of the United States by providing lower cost trajectory injection from earth orbit, transit trajectory control, and planet arrival deceleration to support potential National Aeronautics and Space Administration missions to Mars, Pluto, and other planets.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(6) Satellites stranded in erroneous earth orbit due to deficiencies in their launch represent substantial economic loss to the United States and present substantial concerns for the current backlog of national space assets.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(7) Commercial reusable in-space transportation systems can provide new options for alternative planning approaches and risk management to enhance the mission assurance of national space assets.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(8) Commercial reusable in-space transportation systems developed by the private sector can provide in-space transportation services to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Department of Defense, the National Reconnaissance Office, and other agencies without the need for the United States to bear the cost of production of such systems.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(9) The availability of loan guarantees, with the cost of credit risk to the United States paid by the private-sector, is an effective means by which the United States can help qualifying private-sector companies secure otherwise unattainable private financing for the production of commercial reusable in-space transportation systems, while at the same time minimizing Government commitment and involvement in the development of such systems.&quot;</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(1) commercial activities of the private sector have substantially contributed to the strength of both the United States space program and the national economy;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(2) a robust United States space transportation capability remains a vital cornerstone of the United States space program;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(3) the availability of commercial launch services is essential for the continued growth of the United States commercial space sector;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(4) a timely extension of the excess third party claims payment provisions of the Commercial Space Launch Act [now 51 U.S.C. 50901 et seq.] is appropriate and necessary to enable the private sector to continue covering maximum probable liability risks while protecting the private sector from uninsurable levels of liability which could hinder international competitiveness;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(5) a program to demonstrate how recipients of Federal grants can purchase launch services directly from the private sector has the potential to improve the capabilities of the United States commercial launch industry;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(6) improvements and additions to the Nation's space transportation infrastructure contribute to a robust and cost effective space transportation capability for both public sector and private sector users;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(7) private sector use of available Government facilities on a reimbursable basis contributes to a stronger commercial space sector;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(8) the Federal Government should purchase space goods and services which are commercially available, or could be made available commercially in response to a Government procurement request, whenever such goods or services meet Government mission requirements in a cost effective manner;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(9) it is appropriate for the Government to act as an anchor tenant for commercial space development projects which have a reasonable potential to develop non-Federal markets and which meet Federal needs in a cost effective manner; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(10) the provision of compensation to commercial providers of space goods and services for termination of contracts at the convenience of the Government assists in enabling the private sector to invest in space activities which are initially dependent on Government purchases.&quot;</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;50901. Findings and purposes</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the peaceful uses of outer space continue to be of great value and to offer benefits to all mankind;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) private applications of space technology have achieved a significant level of commercial and economic activity and offer the potential for growth in the future, particularly in the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) new and innovative equipment and services are being sought, produced, and offered by entrepreneurs in telecommunications, information services, microgravity research, human space flight, and remote sensing technologies;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the private sector in the United States has the capability of developing and providing private launching, reentry, and associated services that would complement the launching, reentry, and associated capabilities of the United States Government;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the development of commercial launch vehicles, reentry vehicles, and associated services would enable the United States to retain its competitive position internationally, contributing to the national interest and economic well-being of the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) providing launch services and reentry services by the private sector is consistent with the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States and would be facilitated by stable, minimal, and appropriate regulatory guidelines that are fairly and expeditiously applied;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) the United States should encourage private sector launches, reentries, and associated services and, only to the extent necessary, regulate those launches, reentries, and services to ensure compliance with international obligations of the United States and to protect <!-- PDFPage:118 -->the public health and safety, safety of property, and national security and foreign policy interests of the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) space transportation, including the establishment and operation of launch sites, reentry sites, and complementary facilities, the providing of launch services and reentry services, the establishment of support facilities, and the providing of support services, is an important element of the transportation system of the United States, and in connection with the commerce of the United States there is a need to develop a strong space transportation infrastructure with significant private sector involvement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) the participation of State governments in encouraging and facilitating private sector involvement in space-related activity, particularly through the establishment of a space transportation-related infrastructure, including launch sites, reentry sites, complementary facilities, and launch site and reentry site support facilities, is in the national interest and is of significant public benefit;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) the goal of safely opening space to the American people and their private commercial, scientific, and cultural enterprises should guide Federal space investments, policies, and regulations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) private industry has begun to develop commercial launch vehicles capable of carrying human beings into space and greater private investment in these efforts will stimulate the Nation's commercial space transportation industry as a whole;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) space transportation is inherently risky, and the future of the commercial human space flight industry will depend on its ability to continually improve its safety performance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(13) a critical area of responsibility for the Department of Transportation is to regulate the operations and safety of the emerging commercial human space flight industry;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(14) the public interest is served by creating a clear legal, regulatory, and safety regime for commercial human space flight; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(15) the regulatory standards governing human space flight must evolve as the industry matures so that regulations neither stifle technology development nor expose crew, government astronauts, or space flight participants to avoidable risks as the public comes to expect greater safety for crew, government astronauts, and space flight participants from the industry.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In acting under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Secretary shall consider the commercial availability on reasonable terms of substantially equivalent launch property or launch services or reentry services from a domestic source, whether such source is located on or off a Federal range.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Price</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) In this subsection, &quot;direct costs&quot; means the actual costs that&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In consultation with the Secretary, the head of the executive agency providing the property or service under subsection (a) of this section shall establish the price for the property or service. The price for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) acquiring launch property by sale or transaction instead of sale is the fair market value;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) acquiring launch property (except by sale or transaction instead of sale) is an amount equal to the direct costs, including specific wear and tear and property damage, the Government incurred because of acquisition of the property; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) launch services or reentry services is an amount equal to the direct costs, including the basic pay of Government civilian and contractor personnel, the Government incurred because of acquisition of the services.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Transportation shall determine the amounts required under paragraph (1)(A) and (B) of this subsection, after consulting with the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Secretary of the Air Force, and the heads of other appropriate executive agencies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For the total claims related to one launch or reentry, a licensee or transferee is not required to obtain insurance or demonstrate financial responsibility of more than&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A)(i) $500,000,000 under paragraph (1)(A) of this subsection; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) $100,000,000 under paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the maximum liability insurance available on the world market at reasonable cost if the amount is less than the applicable amount in clause (A)(i) or (ii) of this paragraph.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) An insurance policy or demonstration of financial responsibility under this subsection shall protect the following, to the extent of their potential liability for involvement in launch services or reentry services, at no cost to the Government:</p>

After consulting with the Administrator and the Secretary of the Air Force, the Secretary of Transportation may waive, for the Government and a department, agency, and instrumentality of the Government, the right to recover damages for damage or loss to Government property to the extent insurance is not available because of a policy exclusion the Secretary of Transportation decides is usual for the type of insurance involved.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Determination of Maximum Probable Losses</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation shall determine the maximum probable losses under subsection (a)(1)(A) and (B) of this section associated with an activity under a license not later than 90 days after a licensee or transferee requires a determination and submits all information the Secretary requires.

<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Launches or Reentries Involving Government Facilities and Personnel</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation shall establish requirements consistent with this chapter for proof of financial responsibility and other assurances necessary to protect the Government and its executive agencies and personnel from liability, death, bodily injury, or property damage or loss as a result of a launch or operation of a launch site or reentry site or a reentry involving a facility or personnel of the Government. The Secretary may not relieve the Government of liability under this subsection for death, bodily injury, or property damage or loss resulting from <!-- PDFPage:134 -->the willful misconduct of the Government or its agents.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Collection and Crediting Payments</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The head of a department, agency, or instrumentality of the Government shall collect a payment owed for damage or loss to Government property under its jurisdiction or control resulting from an activity carried out under a launch or reentry license issued or transferred under this chapter.

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;50915. Paying claims exceeding liability insurance and financial responsibility requirements</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>General Requirements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) To the extent provided in advance in an appropriation law or to the extent additional legislative authority is enacted providing for paying claims in a compensation plan submitted under subsection (d) of this section, the Secretary of Transportation shall provide for the payment by the United States Government of a successful claim (including reasonable litigation or settlement expenses) of a third party against a person described in paragraph (3)(A) resulting from an activity carried out under the license issued or transferred under this chapter for death, bodily injury, or property damage or loss resulting from an activity carried out under the license. However, claims may be paid under this section only to the extent the total amount of successful claims related to one launch or reentry&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) is more than the amount of insurance or demonstration of financial responsibility required under section 50914(a)(1)(A) of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) is not more than $1,500,000,000 (plus additional amounts necessary to reflect inflation occurring after January 1, 1989) above that insurance or financial responsibility amount.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may not provide for paying a part of a claim for which death, bodily injury, or property damage or loss results from willful misconduct by the licensee or transferee. To the extent insurance required under section 50914(a)(1)(A) of this title is not available to cover a successful third party liability claim because of an insurance policy exclusion the Secretary decides is usual for the type of insurance involved, the Secretary may provide for paying the excluded claims without regard to the limitation contained in section 50914(a)(1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) A person described in this subparagraph is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) a licensee or transferee under this chapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) a contractor, subcontractor, or customer of the licensee or transferee;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) a contractor or subcontractor of a customer; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) a space flight participant.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Clause (iv) of subparagraph (A) ceases to be effective September 30, 2025.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Notice, Participation, and Approval</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Before a payment under subsection (a) of this section is made&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) notice must be given to the Government of a claim, or a civil action related to the claim, against a party described in subsection (a)(1) of this section for death, bodily injury, or property damage or loss;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the Government must be given an opportunity to participate or assist in the defense of the claim or action; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the Secretary must approve any part of a settlement to be paid out of appropriations of the Government.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Withholding Payments</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may withhold a payment under subsection (a) of this section if the Secretary certifies that the amount is not reasonable. However, the Secretary shall deem to be reasonable the amount of a claim finally decided by a court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Surveys, Reports, and Compensation Plans</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If as a result of an activity carried out under a license issued or transferred under this chapter the total of claims related to one launch or reentry is likely to be more than the amount of required insurance or demonstration of financial responsibility, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) survey the causes and extent of damage; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) submit expeditiously to Congress a report on the results of the survey.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Not later than 90 days after a court determination indicates that the liability for the total of claims related to one launch or reentry may be more than the required amount of insurance or demonstration of financial responsibility, the President, on the recommendation of the Secretary, shall submit to Congress a compensation plan that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) outlines the total dollar value of the claims;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) recommends sources of amounts to pay for the claims;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) includes legislative language required to carry out the plan if additional legislative authority is required; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) for a single event or incident, may not be for more than $1,500,000,000.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A compensation plan submitted to Congress under paragraph (2) of this subsection shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) have an identification number; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) be submitted to the Senate and the House of Representatives on the same day and when the Senate and House are in session.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Congressional Resolutions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) In this subsection, &quot;resolution&quot;&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) means a joint resolution of Congress the matter after the resolving clause of which is as follows: &quot;That the Congress approves the compensation plan numbered &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; submitted to the Congress on &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; XX, 20&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;.&quot;, with the blank spaces being filled appropriately; but</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) does not include a resolution that includes more than one compensation plan.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Senate shall consider under this subsection a compensation plan requiring additional appropriations or legislative authority not later than 60 calendar days of continuous session of Congress after the date on which the plan is submitted to Congress.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A resolution introduced in the Senate shall be referred immediately to a committee by the President of the Senate. All resolutions related to the same plan shall be referred to the same committee.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:136 --><p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) If the committee of the Senate to which a resolution has been referred does not report the resolution within 20 calendar days after it is referred, a motion is in order to discharge the committee from further consideration of the resolution or to discharge the committee from further consideration of the plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A motion to discharge may be made only by an individual favoring the resolution and is highly privileged (except that the motion may not be made after the committee has reported a resolution on the plan). Debate on the motion is limited to one hour, to be divided equally between those favoring and those opposing the resolution. An amendment to the motion is not in order. A motion to reconsider the vote by which the motion is agreed to or disagreed to is not in order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) If the motion to discharge is agreed to or disagreed to, the motion may not be renewed and another motion to discharge the committee from another resolution on the same plan may not be made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) After a committee of the Senate reports, or is discharged from further consideration of, a resolution, a motion to proceed to the consideration of the resolution is in order at any time, even though a similar previous motion has been disagreed to. The motion is highly privileged and is not debatable. An amendment to the motion is not in order. A motion to reconsider the vote by which the motion is agreed to or disagreed to is not in order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Debate on the resolution referred to in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph is limited to not more than 10 hours, to be divided equally between those favoring and those opposing the resolution. A motion further to limit debate is not debatable. An amendment to, or motion to recommit, the resolution is not in order. A motion to reconsider the vote by which the resolution is agreed to or disagreed to is not in order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) The following shall be decided in the Senate without debate:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a motion to postpone related to the discharge from committee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a motion to postpone consideration of a resolution.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) a motion to proceed to the consideration of other business.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) an appeal from a decision of the chair related to the application of the rules of the Senate to the procedures related to a resolution.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Application</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;This section applies to a license issued or transferred under this chapter for which the Secretary receives a complete and valid application not later than September 30, 2025. This section does not apply to permits.</p>

<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 13914, Apr. 6, 2020, 85 F.R. 20381, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including title IV of the U.S. Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act (Public Law 114&ndash;90) [enacting this chapter], it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <i>Policy</i>. Space Policy Directive&ndash;1 of December 11, 2017 (Reinvigorating America's Human Space Exploration Program) [82 F.R. 59501], provides that commercial partners will participate in an &quot;innovative and sustainable program&quot; headed by the United States to &quot;lead the return of humans to the Moon for long-term exploration and utilization, followed by human missions to Mars and other destinations.&quot; Successful long-term exploration and scientific discovery of the Moon, Mars, and other celestial bodies will require partnership with commercial entities to recover and use resources, including water and certain minerals, in outer space.</p>
<p class="note-body">Uncertainty regarding the right to recover and use space resources, including the extension of the right to commercial recovery and use of lunar resources, however, has discouraged some commercial entities from participating in this enterprise. Questions as to whether the 1979 Agreement Governing the Activities of States on the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies (the &quot;Moon Agreement&quot;) establishes the legal framework for nation states concerning the recovery and use of space resources have deepened this uncertainty, particularly because the United States has neither signed nor ratified the Moon Agreement. In fact, only 18 countries have ratified the Moon Agreement, including just 17 of the 95 Member States of the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space. Moreover, differences between the Moon Agreement and the 1967 Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, Including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies&mdash;which the United States and 108 other countries have joined&mdash;also contribute to uncertainty regarding the right to recover and use space resources.</p>
<p class="note-body">Americans should have the right to engage in commercial exploration, recovery, and use of resources in outer space, consistent with applicable law. Outer space is a legally and physically unique domain of human activity, and the United States does not view it as a global commons. Accordingly, it shall be the policy of the United States to encourage international support for the public and private recovery and use of resources in outer space, consistent with applicable law.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec.</cap-smallcap> 2. <i>The Moon Agreement</i>. The United States is not a party to the Moon Agreement. Further, the United States does not consider the Moon Agreement to be an effective or necessary instrument to guide nation states regarding the promotion of commercial participation in the long-term exploration, scientific discovery, and use of the Moon, Mars, or other celestial bodies. Accordingly, the Secretary of State shall object to any attempt by any other state or international or<!-- PDFPage:146 -->ganization to treat the Moon Agreement as reflecting or otherwise expressing customary international law.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec.</cap-smallcap> 3. <i>Encouraging International Support for the Recovery and Use of Space Resources</i>. The Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Transportation, the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the head of any other executive department or agency the Secretary of State determines to be appropriate, shall take all appropriate actions to encourage international support for the public and private recovery and use of resources in outer space, consistent with the policy set forth in section 1 of this order. In carrying out this section, the Secretary of State shall seek to negotiate joint statements and bilateral and multilateral arrangements with foreign states regarding safe and sustainable operations for the public and private recovery and use of space resources.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec.</cap-smallcap> 4. <i>Report on Efforts to Encourage International Support for the Recovery and Use of Space Resources</i>. No later than 180 days after the date of this order [Apr. 6, 2020], the Secretary of State shall report to the President, through the Chair of the National Space Council and the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, regarding activities carried out under section 3 of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec.</cap-smallcap> 5. <i>General Provisions</i>. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:</p>
<p class="note-body">(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or</p>
<p class="note-body">(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.</p>
