<h4 class="note-head">Ex. Ord. No. 14067. Ensuring Responsible Development of Digital Assets</h4>
<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 14067, Mar. 9, 2022, 87 F.R. 14143, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <i>Policy</i>. Advances in digital and distributed ledger technology for financial services have led to dramatic growth in markets for digital assets, with profound implications for the protection of consumers, investors, and businesses, including data privacy and security; financial stability and systemic risk; crime; national security; the ability to exercise human rights; financial inclusion and equity; and energy demand and climate change. In November 2021, non-state issued digital assets reached a combined market capitalization of $3 trillion, up from approximately $14 billion in early <!-- PDFPage:365 -->November 2016. Monetary authorities globally are also exploring, and in some cases introducing, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).</p>
<p class="note-body">While many activities involving digital assets are within the scope of existing domestic laws and regulations, an area where the United States has been a global leader, growing development and adoption of digital assets and related innovations, as well as inconsistent controls to defend against certain key risks, necessitate an evolution and alignment of the United States Government approach to digital assets. The United States has an interest in responsible financial innovation, expanding access to safe and affordable financial services, and reducing the cost of domestic and cross-border funds transfers and payments, including through the continued modernization of public payment systems. We must take strong steps to reduce the risks that digital assets could pose to consumers, investors, and business protections; financial stability and financial system integrity; combating and preventing crime and illicit finance; national security; the ability to exercise human rights; financial inclusion and equity; and climate change and pollution.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec.</cap-smallcap> 2. <i>Objectives</i>. The principal policy objectives of the United States with respect to digital assets are as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) We must protect consumers, investors, and businesses in the United States. The unique and varied features of digital assets can pose significant financial risks to consumers, investors, and businesses if appropriate protections are not in place. In the absence of sufficient oversight and standards, firms providing digital asset services may provide inadequate protections for sensitive financial data, custodial and other arrangements relating to customer assets and funds, or disclosures of risks associated with investment. Cybersecurity and market failures at major digital asset exchanges and trading platforms have resulted in billions of dollars in losses. The United States should ensure that safeguards are in place and promote the responsible development of digital assets to protect consumers, investors, and businesses; maintain privacy; and shield against arbitrary or unlawful surveillance, which can contribute to human rights abuses.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) We must protect United States and global financial stability and mitigate systemic risk. Some digital asset trading platforms and service providers have grown rapidly in size and complexity and may not be subject to or in compliance with appropriate regulations or supervision. Digital asset issuers, exchanges and trading platforms, and intermediaries whose activities may increase risks to financial stability, should, as appropriate, be subject to and in compliance with regulatory and supervisory standards that govern traditional market infrastructures and financial firms, in line with the general principle of &quot;same business, same risks, same rules.&quot; The new and unique uses and functions that digital assets can facilitate may create additional economic and financial risks requiring an evolution to a regulatory approach that adequately addresses those risks.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) We must mitigate the illicit finance and national security risks posed by misuse of digital assets. Digital assets may pose significant illicit finance risks, including money laundering, cybercrime and ransomware, narcotics and human trafficking, and terrorism and proliferation financing. Digital assets may also be used as a tool to circumvent United States and foreign financial sanctions regimes and other tools and authorities. Further, while the United States has been a leader in setting international standards for the regulation and supervision of digital assets for anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT), poor or nonexistent implementation of those standards in some jurisdictions abroad can present significant illicit financing risks for the United States and global financial systems. Illicit actors, including the perpetrators of ransomware incidents and other cybercrime, often launder and cash out of their illicit proceeds using digital asset service providers in jurisdictions that have not yet effectively implemented the international standards set by the inter-governmental Financial Action Task Force (FATF). The continued availability of service providers in jurisdictions where international AML/CFT standards are not effectively implemented enables financial activity without illicit finance controls. Growth in decentralized financial ecosystems, peer-to-peer payment activity, and obscured blockchain ledgers without controls to mitigate illicit finance could also present additional market and national security risks in the future. The United States must ensure appropriate controls and accountability for current and future digital assets systems to promote high standards for transparency, privacy, and security&mdash;including through regulatory, governance, and technological measures&mdash;that counter illicit activities and preserve or enhance the efficacy of our national security tools. When digital assets are abused or used in illicit ways, or undermine national security, it is in the national interest to take actions to mitigate these illicit finance and national security risks through regulation, oversight, law enforcement action, or use of other United States Government authorities.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) We must reinforce United States leadership in the global financial system and in technological and economic competitiveness, including through the responsible development of payment innovations and digital assets. The United States has an interest in ensuring that it remains at the forefront of responsible development and design of digital assets and the technology that underpins new forms of payments and capital flows in the international financial system, particularly in setting standards that promote: democratic values; the rule of law; privacy; the protection of consumers, investors, and businesses; and interoperability with digital platforms, legacy architecture, and international payment systems. The United States derives significant economic and national security benefits from the central role that the United States dollar and United States financial institutions and markets play in the global financial system. Continued United States leadership in the global financial system will sustain United States financial power and promote United States economic interests.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) We must promote access to safe and affordable financial services. Many Americans are underbanked and the costs of cross-border money transfers and payments are high. The United States has a strong interest in promoting responsible innovation that expands equitable access to financial services, particularly for those Americans underserved by the traditional banking system, including by making investments and domestic and cross-border funds transfers and payments cheaper, faster, and safer, and by promoting greater and more cost-efficient access to financial products and services. The United States also has an interest in ensuring that the benefits of financial innovation are enjoyed equitably by all Americans and that any disparate impacts of financial innovation are mitigated.</p>
<p class="note-body">(f) We must support technological advances that promote responsible development and use of digital assets. The technological architecture of different digital assets has substantial implications for privacy, national security, the operational security and resilience of financial systems, climate change, the ability to exercise human rights, and other national goals. The United States has an interest in ensuring that digital asset technologies and the digital payments ecosystem are developed, designed, and implemented in a responsible manner that includes privacy and security in their architecture, integrates features and controls that defend against illicit exploitation, and reduces negative climate impacts and environmental pollution, as may result from some cryptocurrency mining.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec.</cap-smallcap> 3. <i>Coordination</i>. The Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs (APNSA) and the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy (APEP) shall coordinate, through the interagency process described in National Security Memorandum 2 of February 4, 2021 (Renewing the National Security Council System), the <!-- PDFPage:366 -->executive branch actions necessary to implement this order. The interagency process shall include, as appropriate: the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Energy, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the Director of National Intelligence, the Director of the Domestic Policy Council, the Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, the Director of the National Science Foundation, and the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development. Representatives of other executive departments and agencies (agencies) and other senior officials may be invited to attend interagency meetings as appropriate, including, with due respect for their regulatory independence, representatives of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and other Federal regulatory agencies.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec.</cap-smallcap> 4. <i>Policy and Actions Related to United States Central Bank Digital Currencies</i>. (a) The policy of my Administration on a United States CBDC is as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body">(i) Sovereign money is at the core of a well-functioning financial system, macroeconomic stabilization policies, and economic growth. My Administration places the highest urgency on research and development efforts into the potential design and deployment options of a United States CBDC. These efforts should include assessments of possible benefits and risks for consumers, investors, and businesses; financial stability and systemic risk; payment systems; national security; the ability to exercise human rights; financial inclusion and equity; and the actions required to launch a United States CBDC if doing so is deemed to be in the national interest.</p>
<p class="note-body">(ii) My Administration sees merit in showcasing United States leadership and participation in international fora related to CBDCs and in multi-country conversations and pilot projects involving CBDCs. Any future dollar payment system should be designed in a way that is consistent with United States priorities (as outlined in section 4(a)(i) of this order) and democratic values, including privacy protections, and that ensures the global financial system has appropriate transparency, connectivity, and platform and architecture interoperability or transferability, as appropriate.</p>
<p class="note-body">(iii) A United States CBDC may have the potential to support efficient and low-cost transactions, particularly for cross-border funds transfers and payments, and to foster greater access to the financial system, with fewer of the risks posed by private sector-administered digital assets. A United States CBDC that is interoperable with CBDCs issued by other monetary authorities could facilitate faster and lower-cost cross-border payments and potentially boost economic growth, support the continued centrality of the United States within the international financial system, and help to protect the unique role that the dollar plays in global finance. There are also, however, potential risks and downsides to consider. We should prioritize timely assessments of potential benefits and risks under various designs to ensure that the United States remains a leader in the international financial system.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Within 180 days of the date of this order [Mar. 9, 2022], the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the Director of National Intelligence, and the heads of other relevant agencies, shall submit to the President a report on the future of money and payment systems, including the conditions that drive broad adoption of digital assets; the extent to which technological innovation may influence these outcomes; and the implications for the United States financial system, the modernization of and changes to payment systems, economic growth, financial inclusion, and national security. This report shall be coordinated through the interagency process described in section 3 of this order. Based on the potential United States CBDC design options, this report shall include an analysis of:</p>
<p class="note-body">(i) the potential implications of a United States CBDC, based on the possible design choices, for national interests, including implications for economic growth and stability;</p>
<p class="note-body">(ii) the potential implications a United States CBDC might have on financial inclusion;</p>
<p class="note-body">(iii) the potential relationship between a CBDC and private sector-administered digital assets;</p>
<p class="note-body">(iv) the future of sovereign and privately produced money globally and implications for our financial system and democracy;</p>
<p class="note-body">(v) the extent to which foreign CBDCs could displace existing currencies and alter the payment system in ways that could undermine United States financial centrality;</p>
<p class="note-body">(vi) the potential implications for national security and financial crime, including an analysis of illicit financing risks, sanctions risks, other law enforcement and national security interests, and implications for human rights; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(vii) an assessment of the effects that the growth of foreign CBDCs may have on United States interests generally.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) The Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Chairman of the Federal Reserve) is encouraged to continue to research and report on the extent to which CBDCs could improve the efficiency and reduce the costs of existing and future payments systems, to continue to assess the optimal form of a United States CBDC, and to develop a strategic plan for Federal Reserve and broader United States Government action, as appropriate, that evaluates the necessary steps and requirements for the potential implementation and launch of a United States CBDC. The Chairman of the Federal Reserve is also encouraged to evaluate the extent to which a United States CBDC, based on the potential design options, could enhance or impede the ability of monetary policy to function effectively as a critical macroeconomic stabilization tool.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) The Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury and the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, shall:</p>
<p class="note-body">(i) within 180 days of the date of this order, provide to the President through the APNSA and APEP an assessment of whether legislative changes would be necessary to issue a United States CBDC, should it be deemed appropriate and in the national interest; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(ii) within 210 days of the date of this order, provide to the President through the APNSA and the APEP a corresponding legislative proposal, based on consideration of the report submitted by the Secretary of the Treasury under section 4(b) of this order and any materials developed by the Chairman of the Federal Reserve consistent with section 4(c) of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec.</cap-smallcap> 5. <i>Measures to Protect Consumers, Investors, and Businesses</i>. (a) The increased use of digital assets and digital asset exchanges and trading platforms may increase the risks of crimes such as fraud and theft, other statutory and regulatory violations, privacy and data breaches, unfair and abusive acts or practices, and other cyber incidents faced by consumers, investors, and businesses. The rise in use of digital assets, and differences across communities, may also present disparate financial risk to less informed market participants or exacerbate inequities. It is critical to ensure that digital assets do not pose undue risks to consumers, investors, or businesses, and to put in place protections as a part of efforts to expand access to safe and affordable financial services.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:367 --><p class="note-body">(b) Consistent with the goals stated in section 5(a) of this order:</p>
<p class="note-body">(i) Within 180 days of the date of this order [Mar. 9, 2022], the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of Labor and the heads of other relevant agencies, including, as appropriate, the heads of independent regulatory agencies such as the FTC, the SEC, the CFTC, Federal banking agencies, and the CFPB, shall submit to the President a report, or section of the report required by section 4 of this order, on the implications of developments and adoption of digital assets and changes in financial market and payment system infrastructures for United States consumers, investors, businesses, and for equitable economic growth. One section of the report shall address the conditions that would drive mass adoption of different types of digital assets and the risks and opportunities such growth might present to United States consumers, investors, and businesses, including a focus on how technological innovation may impact these efforts and with an eye toward those most vulnerable to disparate impacts. The report shall also include policy recommendations, including potential regulatory and legislative actions, as appropriate, to protect United States consumers, investors, and businesses, and support expanding access to safe and affordable financial services. The report shall be coordinated through the interagency process described in section 3 of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body">(ii) Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy and the Chief Technology Officer of the United States, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, and the heads of other relevant agencies, shall submit to the President a technical evaluation of the technological infrastructure, capacity, and expertise that would be necessary at relevant agencies to facilitate and support the introduction of a CBDC system should one be proposed. The evaluation should specifically address the technical risks of the various designs, including with respect to emerging and future technological developments, such as quantum computing. The evaluation should also include any reflections or recommendations on how the inclusion of digital assets in Federal processes may affect the work of the United States Government and the provision of Government services, including risks and benefits to cybersecurity, customer experience, and social-safety-net programs. The evaluation shall be coordinated through the interagency process described in section 3 of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body">(iii) Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Homeland Security, shall submit to the President a report on the role of law enforcement agencies in detecting, investigating, and prosecuting criminal activity related to digital assets. The report shall include any recommendations on regulatory or legislative actions, as appropriate.</p>
<p class="note-body">(iv) The Attorney General, the Chair of the FTC, and the Director of the CFPB are each encouraged to consider what, if any, effects the growth of digital assets could have on competition policy.</p>
<p class="note-body">(v) The Chair of the FTC and the Director of the CFPB are each encouraged to consider the extent to which privacy or consumer protection measures within their respective jurisdictions may be used to protect users of digital assets and whether additional measures may be needed.</p>
<p class="note-body">(vi) The Chair of the SEC, the Chairman of the CFTC, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, the Chairperson of the Board of Directors of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Comptroller of the Currency are each encouraged to consider the extent to which investor and market protection measures within their respective jurisdictions may be used to address the risks of digital assets and whether additional measures may be needed.</p>
<p class="note-body">(vii) Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Energy, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, the Assistant to the President and National Climate Advisor, and the heads of other relevant agencies, shall submit a report to the President on the connections between distributed ledger technology and short-, medium-, and long-term economic and energy transitions; the potential for these technologies to impede or advance efforts to tackle climate change at home and abroad; and the impacts these technologies have on the environment. This report shall be coordinated through the interagency process described in section 3 of this order. The report should also address the effect of cryptocurrencies&apos; consensus mechanisms on energy usage, including research into potential mitigating measures and alternative mechanisms of consensus and the design tradeoffs those may entail. The report should specifically address:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(A) potential uses of blockchain that could support monitoring or mitigating technologies to climate impacts, such as exchanging of liabilities for greenhouse gas emissions, water, and other natural or environmental assets; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(B) implications for energy policy, including as it relates to grid management and reliability, energy efficiency incentives and standards, and sources of energy supply.</p>
<p class="note-body">(viii) Within 1 year of submission of the report described in section 5(b)(vii) of this order, the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Energy, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, and the heads of other relevant agencies, shall update the report described in section 5(b)(vii) of this order, including to address any knowledge gaps identified in such report.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec.</cap-smallcap> 6. <i>Actions to Promote Financial Stability, Mitigate Systemic Risk, and Strengthen Market Integrity</i>. (a) Financial regulators&mdash;including the SEC, the CFTC, and the CFPB and Federal banking agencies&mdash;play critical roles in establishing and overseeing protections across the financial system that safeguard its integrity and promote its stability. Since 2017, the Secretary of the Treasury has convened the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) to assess the financial stability risks and regulatory gaps posed by the ongoing adoption of digital assets. The United States must assess and take steps to address risks that digital assets pose to financial stability and financial market integrity.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Within 210 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Treasury should convene the FSOC and produce a report outlining the specific financial stability risks and regulatory gaps posed by various types of digital assets and providing recommendations to address such risks. As the Secretary of the Treasury and the FSOC deem appropriate, the report should consider the particular features of various types of digital assets and include recommendations that address the identified financial stability risks posed by these digital assets, including any proposals for additional or adjusted regulation and supervision as well as for new legislation. The report should take account of the prior analyses and assessments of the FSOC, agencies, and the President's Working Group on Financial Markets, including the ongoing work of the Federal banking agencies, as appropriate.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec.</cap-smallcap> 7. <i>Actions to Limit Illicit Finance and Associated National Security Risks</i>. (a) Digital assets have facilitated sophisticated cybercrime-related financial networks and activity, including through ransomware activity. The growing use of digital assets in financial activity heightens risks of crimes such as money laundering, terrorist and proliferation financing, fraud and theft schemes, and corruption. These illicit activities highlight the need for ongoing scrutiny of the use of digital assets, the extent to which technological innovation may impact such activities, and exploration of opportunities to mitigate these risks through regulation, supervision, public-private engagement, oversight, and law enforcement.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:368 --><p class="note-body">(b) Within 90 days of submission to the Congress of the National Strategy for Combating Terrorist and Other Illicit Financing, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the Director of National Intelligence, and the heads of other relevant agencies may each submit to the President supplemental annexes, which may be classified or unclassified, to the Strategy offering additional views on illicit finance risks posed by digital assets, including cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, CBDCs, and trends in the use of digital assets by illicit actors.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Within 120 days of submission to the Congress of the National Strategy for Combating Terrorist and Other Illicit Financing, the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the Director of National Intelligence, and the heads of other relevant agencies shall develop a coordinated action plan based on the Strategy's conclusions for mitigating the digital-asset-related illicit finance and national security risks addressed in the updated strategy. This action plan shall be coordinated through the interagency process described in section 3 of this order. The action plan shall address the role of law enforcement and measures to increase financial services providers&apos; compliance with AML/CFT obligations related to digital asset activities.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) Within 120 days following completion of all of the following reports&mdash;the National Money Laundering Risk Assessment; the National Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment; the National Proliferation Financing Risk Assessment; and the updated National Strategy for Combating Terrorist and Other Illicit Financing&mdash;the Secretary of the Treasury shall notify the relevant agencies through the interagency process described in section 3 of this order on any pending, proposed, or prospective rulemakings to address digital asset illicit finance risks. The Secretary of the Treasury shall consult with and consider the perspectives of relevant agencies in evaluating opportunities to mitigate such risks through regulation.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec.</cap-smallcap> 8. <i>Policy and Actions Related to Fostering International Cooperation and United States Competitiveness</i>. (a) The policy of my Administration on fostering international cooperation and United States competitiveness with respect to digital assets and financial innovation is as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body">(i) Technology-driven financial innovation is frequently cross-border and therefore requires international cooperation among public authorities. This cooperation is critical to maintaining high regulatory standards and a level playing field. Uneven regulation, supervision, and compliance across jurisdictions creates opportunities for arbitrage and raises risks to financial stability and the protection of consumers, investors, businesses, and markets. Inadequate AML/CFT regulation, supervision, and enforcement by other countries challenges the ability of the United States to investigate illicit digital asset transaction flows that frequently jump overseas, as is often the case in ransomware payments and other cybercrime-related money laundering. There must also be cooperation to reduce inefficiencies in international funds transfer and payment systems.</p>
<p class="note-body">(ii) The United States Government has been active in international fora and through bilateral partnerships on many of these issues and has a robust agenda to continue this work in the coming years. While the United States held the position of President of the FATF, the United States led the group in developing and adopting the first international standards on digital assets. The United States must continue to work with international partners on standards for the development and appropriate interoperability of digital payment architectures and CBDCs to reduce payment inefficiencies and ensure that any new funds transfer and payment systems are consistent with United States values and legal requirements.</p>
<p class="note-body">(iii) While the United States held the position of President of the 2020 G7, the United States established the G7 Digital Payments Experts Group to discuss CBDCs, stablecoins, and other digital payment issues. The G7 report outlining a set of policy principles for CBDCs is an important contribution to establishing guidelines for jurisdictions for the exploration and potential development of CBDCs. While a CBDC would be issued by a country's central bank, the supporting infrastructure could involve both public and private participants. The G7 report highlighted that any CBDC should be grounded in the G7's long-standing public commitments to transparency, the rule of law, and sound economic governance, as well as the promotion of competition and innovation.</p>
<p class="note-body">(iv) The United States continues to support the G20 roadmap for addressing challenges and frictions with cross-border funds transfers and payments for which work is underway, including work on improvements to existing systems for cross-border funds transfers and payments, the international dimensions of CBDC designs, and the potential of well-regulated stablecoin arrangements. The international Financial Stability Board (FSB), together with standard-setting bodies, is leading work on issues related to stablecoins, cross-border funds transfers and payments, and other international dimensions of digital assets and payments, while FATF continues its leadership in setting AML/CFT standards for digital assets. Such international work should continue to address the full spectrum of issues and challenges raised by digital assets, including financial stability, consumer, investor, and business risks, and money laundering, terrorist financing, proliferation financing, sanctions evasion, and other illicit activities.</p>
<p class="note-body">(v) My Administration will elevate the importance of these topics and expand engagement with our critical international partners, including through fora such as the G7, G20, FATF, and FSB. My Administration will support the ongoing international work and, where appropriate, push for additional work to drive development and implementation of holistic standards, cooperation and coordination, and information sharing. With respect to digital assets, my Administration will seek to ensure that our core democratic values are respected; consumers, investors, and businesses are protected; appropriate global financial system connectivity and platform and architecture interoperability are preserved; and the safety and soundness of the global financial system and international monetary system are maintained.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) In furtherance of the policy stated in section 8(a) of this order:</p>
<p class="note-body">(i) Within 120 days of the date of this order [Mar. 9, 2022], the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Commerce, the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development, and the heads of other relevant agencies, shall establish a framework for interagency international engagement with foreign counterparts and in international fora to, as appropriate, adapt, update, and enhance adoption of global principles and standards for how digital assets are used and transacted, and to promote development of digital asset and CBDC technologies consistent with our values and legal requirements. This framework shall be coordinated through the interagency process described in section 3 of this order. This framework shall include specific and prioritized lines of effort and coordinated messaging; interagency engagement and activities with foreign partners, such as foreign assistance and capacity-building efforts and coordination of global compliance; and whole-of-government efforts to promote international principles, standards, and best practices. This framework should reflect ongoing leadership by the Secretary of the Treasury and financial regulators in relevant international financial standards bodies, and should elevate United States engagement on digital assets issues in technical standards bodies and other international fora to promote development of <!-- PDFPage:369 -->digital asset and CBDC technologies consistent with our values.</p>
<p class="note-body">(ii) Within 1 year of the date of the establishment of the framework required by section 8(b)(i) of this order, the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Commerce, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development, and the heads of other relevant agencies as appropriate, shall submit a report to the President on priority actions taken under the framework and its effectiveness. This report shall be coordinated through the interagency process described in section 3 of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body">(iii) Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the heads of other relevant agencies, shall establish a framework for enhancing United States economic competitiveness in, and leveraging of, digital asset technologies. This framework shall be coordinated through the interagency process described in section 3 of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body">(iv) Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the Secretary of Homeland Security, shall submit a report to the President on how to strengthen international law enforcement cooperation for detecting, investigating, and prosecuting criminal activity related to digital assets.</p>

<p class="note-body">The word &quot;money&quot; is substituted for &quot;money of account&quot; to eliminate unnecessary words. As far as can be determined, the phrase &quot;money of account&quot; has not been interpreted by any court or Government agency. The phrase was used by Alexander Hamilton in his &quot;Report on the Establishment of the Mint&quot; (1791). In that Report, Hamilton propounded 6 questions, including:</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&#160;1st. What ought to be the nature of the money unit of the United States?</p>
<p class="note-body-block">Thereafter, Hamilton uses the phrases &quot;money unit of the United States&quot; and &quot;money of account&quot; interchangeably and in the sense that the phrases are used to denote the monetary system for keeping financial accounts. In short, the phrases simply indicate that financial accounts are to be based on a decimal money system:</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">.&#160;.&#160;., and it is certain that nothing can be more simple and convenient than the decimal subdivisions. There is every reason to expect that the method will speedily grow into general use, when it shall be seconded by corresponding coins. On this plan the unit in the money of account will continue to be, as established by that resolution [of August 8, 1786], a dollar, and its multiples, dimes, cents, and mills, or tenths, hundreths, [sic] and thousands.</p>
<p class="note-body-block">Thus, the phrase &quot;money of account&quot; did not mean, by itself, that dollars or fractions of dollars must be equal to something having intrinsic or &quot;substantive&quot; value. This concept is supported by earlier writings of Thomas Jefferson in his &quot;Notes on the Establishment of a Money Unit, and of a Coinage for the United States&quot; (1784), and the 1782 report to the President of the Continental Congress on the coinage of the United States by the Superintendent of Finances, Robert Morris, which was apparently prepared by the Assistant Superintendent, Gouverneur Morris. See Paul L. Ford, <i>The Writings of Thomas Jefferson</i>, vol. III (G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1894) pp. 446&ndash;457; William G. Sumner, <i>The Financier and the Finances of the American Revolution</i>, vol. II (Burt Franklin, 1891, reprinted 1970) pp. 36&ndash;47; and George T. Curtis, <i>History of the Constitution</i>, vol. I (Harper and Brothers, 1859) p. 443, n2. The words &quot;or units&quot; and &quot;and all accounts in the public offices and all proceedings in the courts shall be kept and had in conformity to this regulation&quot; are omitted as surplus.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Department of the Treasury has a coinage metal fund and a coinage profit fund. The Secretary may use the coinage metal fund to buy metal to mint coins.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Subparagraph (A) shall apply only in the case of a bid or offer from a supplier the principal place of business of which is in a foreign country which does not accord to United States companies the same competitive opportunities for procurements in connection with the production of coins as it accords to domestic companies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Determination.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Any determination of the Secretary referred to in paragraph (2) shall not be reviewable in any administrative proceeding or court of the United States.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) The half dollar, quarter dollar, and dime coins are clad coins with 3 layers of metal. The 2 identical outer layers are an alloy of 75 percent copper and 25 percent nickel. The inner layer is copper. The outer layers are metallurgically bonded to the inner layer and weigh at least 30 percent of the weight of the coin. The <!-- PDFPage:375 -->dollar coin shall be golden in color, have a distinctive edge, have tactile and visual features that make the denomination of the coin readily discernible, be minted and fabricated in the United States, and have similar metallic, anti-counterfeiting properties as United States coinage in circulation on the date of enactment of the United States $1 Coin Act of 1997. The 5-cent coin is an alloy of 75 percent copper and 25 percent nickel. In minting 5-cent coins, the Secretary shall use bars that vary not more than 2.5 percent from the percent of nickel required. Except as provided under subsection (c) of this section, the one-cent coin is an alloy of 95 percent copper and 5 percent zinc. In minting gold coins, the Secretary shall use alloys that vary not more than 0.1 percent from the percent of gold required. The specifications for alloys are by weight.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Secretary may prescribe the weight and the composition of copper and zinc in the alloy of the one-cent coin that the Secretary decides are appropriate when the Secretary decides that a different weight and alloy of copper and zinc are necessary to ensure an adequate supply of one-cent coins to meet the needs of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) United States coins shall have the inscription &quot;In God We Trust&quot;. The obverse side of each coin shall have the inscription &quot;Liberty&quot;.

The design on the reverse side of the dollar, half dollar, and quarter dollar is an eagle. Subject to other provisions of this subsection, the obverse of any 5-cent coin issued after December 31, 2005, shall bear the likeness of Thomas Jefferson and the reverse of any such 5-cent coin shall bear an image of the home of Thomas Jefferson at Monticello. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Congress, shall select appropriate designs for the obverse and reverse sides of the dollar coin. The coins have an inscription of the year of minting or issuance. However, to prevent or alleviate a shortage of a denomination, the Secretary may inscribe coins of the denomination with the year that was last inscribed on coins of the denomination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall prepare the devices, models, hubs, and dies for coins, emblems, devices, inscriptions, and designs authorized under this chapter. The Secretary may, after consulting with the Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee and the Commission of Fine Arts, adopt and prepare new designs or models of emblems or devices that are authorized in the same way as when new coins or devices are authorized. The Secretary may change the design or die of a coin only once within 25 years of the first adoption of the design, model, hub, or die for that coin. The Secretary may procure services under section 3109 of title 5 in carrying out this paragraph.</p>

<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 116&ndash;286, Jan. 5, 2021, 134 Stat. 4879, provided that:</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&quot;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&quot;This Act may be cited as the &apos;1921 Silver Dollar Coin Anniversary Act&apos;.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&quot;SEC. 2. FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&quot;The Congress finds that [sic] following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(1) In December 1921, the Peace silver dollar was approved by Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon, replacing the Morgan silver dollar and commemorating the declaration of peace between the United States and the Imperial German government.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(2) The Peace silver dollar was minted in Philadelphia, Denver and San Francisco. The Morgan silver dollar was minted at Philadelphia, Denver, San Francisco, Carson City, and New Orleans.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(3) The Peace silver dollar was designed by Anthony de Francisci with the Goddess of Liberty on the obverse and a bald eagle clutching the olive branch (a symbol of peace) on the reverse. The Peace silver dollars were minted between 1921 to 1935.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:393 --><p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(4) The Morgan silver dollar was designed by George T. Morgan and was minted from 1878 to 1904, and again in 1921. The obverse depicts a profile portrait of Lady Liberty and on the reverse, a heraldic eagle.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(5) The conversion from the Morgan silver dollar to the Peace silver dollar design in 1921 reflected a pivotal moment in American history. The Morgan silver dollar represents the country's westward expansion and industrial development in the late 19th century. The Peace silver dollar symbolizes the country's coming of age as an international power while recognizing the sacrifices made by her citizens in World War I and celebrating the victory and peace that ensued.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(6) These iconic silver dollars with vastly different representations of Lady Liberty and the American Eagle, reflect a changing of the guard in 1921 in the United States and therefore on the 100th anniversary must begin to be minted again to commemorate this significant evolution of American freedom.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&quot;SEC. 3. COIN SPECIFICATIONS.</h4>

<h4 class="note-head">Findings of 2008 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 110&ndash;456, title I, &sect;101, Dec. 23, 2008, 122 Stat. 5038, provided that: &quot;The Congress finds as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(1) Yellowstone National Park was established by an Act signed by President Ulysses S. Grant on March 1, 1872, as the Nation's first national park.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(2) The summer and autumn of 1890 saw the establishment of a number of national sites:</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&quot;(A) August 19: Chickamauga and Chattanooga established as national military parks in Georgia and Tennessee.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&quot;(B) August 30: Antietam established as a national battlefield site in Maryland.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&quot;(C) September 25: Sequoia National Park established in California.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&quot;(D) September 27: Rock Creek Park established in the District of Columbia.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&quot;(E) October 1: General Grant National Park established in California (and subsequently incorporated in Kings Canyon National Park).</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&quot;(F) October 1: Yosemite National Park established in California.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(3) Theodore Roosevelt was this nation's 26th President and is considered by many to be our &apos;Conservationist President&apos;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(4) As a frequent visitor to the West, Theodore Roosevelt witnessed the virtual destruction of some big game species and the overgrazing that destroyed the grasslands and with them the habitats for small mammals and songbirds and conservation increasingly became one of his major concerns.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(5) When he became President in 1901, Roosevelt pursued this interest in conservation by establishing the first 51 Bird Reserves, 4 Game Preserves, and 150 National Forests.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(6) He also established the United States Forest Service, signed into law the creation of 5 National Parks, and signed the Act for the Preservation of American Antiquities in 1906 under which he proclaimed 18 national monuments.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(7) Approximately 230,000,000 acres of area within the United States was placed under public protection by Theodore Roosevelt.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(8) Theodore Roosevelt said that nothing short of defending this country in wartime &apos;compares in importance with the great central task of leaving this land even a better land for our descendants than it is for us&apos;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(9) The National Park Service was created by an Act signed by President Woodrow Wilson on August 25, 1916.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(10) The National Park System comprises 391 areas covering more than 84,000,000 acres in every State (except Delaware), the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(11) The sites or areas within the National Park System vary widely in size and type from vast natural wilderness to birthplaces of Presidents to world heritage archaeology sites to an African burial ground memorial in Manhattan and include national parks, monuments, battlefields, military parks, historical parks, historic sites, lakeshores, seashores, recreation areas, scenic rivers and trails, and the White House.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(12) In addition to the sites within the National Park System, the United States has placed numerous other types of sites under various forms of conser<!-- PDFPage:395 -->vancy, such as the national forests and sites within the National Wildlife Refuge System and on the National Register of Historic Places.&quot;</p>

<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 109&ndash;230, &sect;8, June 15, 2006, 120 Stat. 393, provided that: &quot;Notwithstanding the fifth sentence of section 5112(d)(1) of title 31, United States Code, the Secretary of the Treasury may continue to issue, after December 31, 2005, numismatic items that contain 5-cent coins minted in the years 2004 and 2005.&quot;</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Presidential Commemorative Dollar Coins; Findings</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 109&ndash;145, title I, &sect;101, Dec. 22, 2005, 119 Stat. 2664, provided that: &quot;Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(1) There are sectors of the United States economy, including public transportation, parking meters, vending machines, and low-dollar value transactions, in which the use of a $1 coin is both useful and desirable for keeping costs and prices down.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(2) For a variety of reasons, the new $1 coin introduced in 2000 has not been widely sought-after by the public, leading to higher costs for merchants and thus higher prices for consumers.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(3) The success of the 50 States Commemorative Coin Program (31 U.S.C. 5112(l)) for circulating quarter dollars shows that a design on a United States circulating coin that is regularly changed in a manner similar to the systematic change in designs in such Program radically increases demand for the coin, rapidly pulling it through the economy.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(4) The 50 States Commemorative Coin Program also has been an educational tool, teaching both Americans and visitors something about each State for which a quarter has been issued.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(5) A national survey and study by the Government Accountability Office has indicated that many Americans who do not seek, or who reject, the new $1 coin for use in commerce would actively seek the coin if an attractive, educational rotating design were to be struck on the coin.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(6) The President is the leader of our tripartite government and the President's spouse has often set the social tone for the White House while spearheading and highlighting important issues for the country.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(7) Sacagawea, as currently represented on the new $1 coin, is an important symbol of American history.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(8) Many people cannot name all of the Presidents, and fewer can name the spouses, nor can many people accurately place each President in the proper time period of American history.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(9) First Spouses have not generally been recognized on American coinage.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(10) In order to revitalize the design of United States coinage and return circulating coinage to its position as not only a necessary means of exchange in commerce, but also as an object of aesthetic beauty in its own right, it is appropriate to move many of the mottos and emblems, the inscription of the year, and the so-called &apos;mint marks&apos; that currently appear on the 2 faces of each circulating coin to the edge of the coin, which would allow larger and more dramatic artwork on the coins reminiscent of the so-called &apos;Golden Age of Coinage&apos; in the United States, at the beginning of the Twentieth Century, initiated by President Theodore Roosevelt, with the assistance of noted sculptors and medallic artists James Earle Fraser and Augustus Saint-Gaudens.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(11) Placing inscriptions on the edge of coins, known as edge-incusing, is a hallmark of modern coinage and is common in large-volume production of coinage elsewhere in the world, such as the 2,700,000,000 2-Euro coins in circulation, but it has not been done on a large scale in United States coinage in recent years.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(12) Although the Congress has authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to issue gold coins with a purity of 99.99 percent, the Secretary has not done so.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(13) Bullion coins are a valuable tool for the investor and, in some cases, an important aspect of coin collecting.&quot;</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial 1-cent Coin Redesign</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 109&ndash;145, title III, Dec. 22, 2005, 119 Stat. 2673, provided that:</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&quot;SEC. 301. FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&quot;Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(1) Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President, was one of the Nation's greatest leaders, demonstrating true courage during the Civil War, one of the greatest crises in the Nation's history.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(2) Born of humble roots in Hardin County (present-day LaRue County), Kentucky, on February 12, 1809, Abraham Lincoln rose to the Presidency through a combination of honesty, integrity, intelligence, and commitment to the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(3) With the belief that all men are created equal, Abraham Lincoln led the effort to free all slaves in the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(4) Abraham Lincoln had a generous heart, with malice toward none, and with charity for all.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(5) Abraham Lincoln gave the ultimate sacrifice for the country he loved, dying from an assassin's bullet on April 15, 1865.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(6) All Americans could benefit from studying the life of Abraham Lincoln, for Lincoln's life is a model for accomplishing the &apos;American dream&apos; through honesty, integrity, loyalty, and a lifetime of education.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(7) The year 2009 will be the bicentennial anniversary of the birth of Abraham Lincoln.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(8) Abraham Lincoln was born in Kentucky, grew to adulthood in Indiana, achieved fame in Illinois, and led the nation in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(9) The so-called &apos;Lincoln cent&apos; was introduced in 1909 on the 100th anniversary of Lincoln's birth, making the obverse design the most enduring on the nation's coinage.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(10) President Theodore Roosevelt was so impressed by the talent of Victor David Brenner that the sculptor was chosen to design the likeness of President Lincoln for the coin, adapting a design from a plaque Brenner had prepared earlier.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(11) In the nearly 100 years of production of the &apos;Lincoln cent&apos;, there have been only 2 designs on the reverse: the original, featuring 2 wheat-heads in memorial style enclosing mottoes, and the current representation of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(12) On the occasion of the bicentennial of President Lincoln's birth and the 100th anniversary of the production of the Lincoln cent, it is entirely fitting to issue a series of 1-cent coins with designs on the reverse that are emblematic of the 4 major periods of President Lincoln's life.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&quot;SEC. 302. REDESIGN OF LINCOLN CENT FOR 2009.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(a) <cap-smallcap>In General</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;During the year 2009, the Secretary of the Treasury shall issue 1-cent coins in accordance with the following design specifications:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(1) <cap-smallcap>Obverse</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The obverse of the 1-cent coin shall continue to bear the Victor David Brenner likeness of President Abraham Lincoln.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:396 --><p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(2) <cap-smallcap>Reverse</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The reverse of the coins shall bear 4 different designs each representing a different aspect of the life of Abraham Lincoln, such as&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&quot;(A) his birth and early childhood in Kentucky;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&quot;(B) his formative years in Indiana;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&quot;(C) his professional life in Illinois; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&quot;(D) his presidency, in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(b) <cap-smallcap>Issuance of Redesigned Lincoln Cents in</cap-smallcap> 2009.&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(1) <cap-smallcap>Order</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The 1-cent coins to which this section applies shall be issued with 1 of the 4 designs referred to in subsection (a)(2) beginning at the start of each calendar quarter of 2009.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(2) <cap-smallcap>Number</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall prescribe, on the basis of such factors as the Secretary determines to be appropriate, the number of 1-cent coins that shall be issued with each of the designs selected for each calendar quarter of 2009.</p>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(c) <cap-smallcap>Design Selection</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The designs for the coins specified in this section shall be chosen by the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(1) after consultation with the Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission and the Commission of Fine Arts; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(2) after review by the Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&quot;SEC. 303. REDESIGN OF REVERSE OF 1-CENT COINS AFTER 2009.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&quot;The design on the reverse of the 1-cent coins issued after December 31, 2009, shall bear an image emblematic of President Lincoln's preservation of the United States of America as a single and united country.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&quot;SEC. 304. NUMISMATIC PENNIES WITH THE SAME METALLIC CONTENT AS THE 1909 PENNY.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&quot;The Secretary of the Treasury shall issue 1-cent coins in 2009 with the exact metallic content as the 1-cent coin contained in 1909 in such number as the Secretary determines to be appropriate for numismatic purposes.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&quot;SEC. 305. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&quot;It is the sense of the Congress that the original Victor David Brenner design for the 1-cent coin was a dramatic departure from previous American coinage that should be reproduced, using the original form and relief of the likeness of Abraham Lincoln, on the 1-cent coins issued in 2009.&quot;</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Designs on the 5-Cent Coin</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 108&ndash;15, title I, &sect;101, Apr. 23, 2003, 117 Stat. 615, provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(a) <cap-smallcap>In General</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Subject to subsection (b) and after consulting with the Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee and the Commission of Fine Arts, the Secretary of the Treasury may change the design on the obverse and the reverse of the 5-cent coin for coins issued in 2003, 2004, and 2005 in recognition of the bicentennial of the Louisiana Purchase and the expedition of Meriwether Lewis and William Clark.</p>

The words &quot;United States currency and security documents of the United States Government and currency and bonds of the United States territories and possessions&quot; are substituted for &quot;the backs and tints of all United States bonds, the backs and tints of all United States paper money, and the backs and tints of bonds and paper money issued by any of the insular possessions of the United States&quot; in 31:177 to eliminate unnecessary words and for clarity and consistency in the revised title. The words &quot;other security documents and checks&quot; are substituted for &quot;checks&quot; because only currency and bonds must be printed from intaglio plates. The text of 31:177(1st proviso) is omitted as unnecessary because of the authority of the Secretary to engrave and print restated in the subsection and the source provisions restated in section 303 of the revised title.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) buy the gold with any direct obligations of the United States Government or United States coins and currency authorized by law, or with amounts in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Amounts received from the purchase of gold are an asset of the general fund of the Treasury. Amounts received from the sale of gold shall be deposited by the Secretary in the general fund of the Treasury and shall be used for the sole purpose of reducing the national debt.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall acquire gold for the coins issued under section 5112(i) of this title by purchase of gold mined from natural deposits in the United States, or in a territory or possession <!-- PDFPage:402 -->of the United States, within one year after the month in which the ore from which it is derived was mined. The Secretary shall pay not more than the average world price for the gold. In the absence of available supplies of such gold at the average world price, the Secretary may use gold from reserves held by the United States to mint the coins issued under section 5112(i) of this title. The Secretary shall issue such regulations as may be necessary to carry out this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) The Secretary may buy silver mined from natural deposits in the United States, or in a territory or possession of the United States, that is brought to a United States mint or assay office within one year after the month in which the ore from which it is derived was mined. The Secretary may use the coinage metal fund under section 5111(b) of this title to buy silver under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may sell or use Government silver to mint coins, except silver transferred to stockpiles established under the Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act (50 U.S.C. 98 et seq.). The Secretary shall obtain the silver for the coins authorized under section 5112(e) of this title by purchase from stockpiles established under the Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act (50 U.S.C. 98 et seq.). At such time as the silver stockpile is depleted, the Secretary shall obtain silver as described in paragraph (1) to mint coins authorized under section 5112(e). If it is not economically feasible to obtain such silver, the Secretary may obtain silver for coins authorized under section 5112(e) from other available sources. The Secretary shall not pay more than the average world price for silver under any circumstances. As used in this paragraph, the term &quot;average world price&quot; means the price determined by a widely recognized commodity exchange at the time the silver is obtained by the Secretary. The Secretary shall sell silver under conditions the Secretary considers appropriate for at least $1.292929292 a fine troy ounce.</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(1) Mexico is an important neighbor and trading partner of the United States;</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(3) the program of assistance involves the participation of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the International Monetary Fund, the Bank for International Settlements, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Inter-American Development Bank, the Bank of Canada, and several Latin American countries;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(4) the involvement of the exchange stabilization fund and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System means that United States taxpayer funds will be used in the assistance effort to Mexico;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(5) assistance provided by the International Monetary Fund, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the Inter-American Development Bank may require additional United States contributions of taxpayer funds to those entities;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(6) the immediate use of taxpayer funds and the potential requirement for additional future United States contributions of taxpayer funds necessitates congressional oversight of the disbursement of funds; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(7) the efficacy of the assistance to Mexico is contingent on the pursuit of sound economic policy by the Government of Mexico.</p>

<h4 class="note-sub-head">&quot;SEC. 7701. IMPROVING INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS AND COOPERATION TO FIGHT TERRORIST FINANCING.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(1) The global war on terrorism and cutting off terrorist financing is a policy priority for the United States and its partners, working bilaterally and multilaterally through the United Nations, the United Nations Security Council and its committees, such as the 1267 and 1373 Committees, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), and various international financial institutions, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), and the regional multilateral development banks, and other multilateral fora.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(2) The international financial community has become engaged in the global fight against terrorist financing. The Financial Action Task Force has focused on the new threat posed by terrorist financing to the international financial system, resulting in the establishment of the FATF's Eight Special Recommendations on Terrorist Financing as the international standard on combating terrorist financing. The Group of Seven and the Group of Twenty Finance Ministers are developing action plans to curb the financing of terror. In addition, other economic and regional fora, such as the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Forum, and the Western Hemisphere Financial Ministers, have been used to marshal political will and actions in support of combating the financing of terrorism (CFT) standards.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(3) FATF's Forty Recommendations on Money Laundering and the Eight Special Recommendations on Terrorist Financing are the recognized global standards for fighting money laundering and terrorist financing. The FATF has engaged in an assessment process for jurisdictions based on their compliance with these standards.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(4) In March 2004, the IMF and IBRD Boards agreed to make permanent a pilot program of collaboration with the FATF to assess global compliance with the FATF Forty Recommendations on Money Laundering and the Eight Special Recommendations on Terrorist Financing. As a result, anti-money laundering (AML) and combating the financing of terrorism (CFT) assessments are now a regular part of their Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) and Offshore Financial Center assessments, which provide for a comprehensive analysis of the strength of a jurisdiction's financial system. These reviews assess potential systemic vulnerabilities, consider sectoral development needs and priorities, and review the state of implementation of and compliance with key financial codes and regulatory standards, among them the AML and CFT standards.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(5) To date, 70 FSAPs have been conducted, with over 24 of those incorporating AML and CFT assessments. The international financial institutions (IFIs), the FATF, and the FATF-style regional bodies together are expected to assess AML and CFT regimes in up to 40 countries or jurisdictions per year. This will help countries and jurisdictions identify deficiencies in their AML and CFT regimes and help focus technical assistance efforts.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(6) Technical assistance programs from the United States and other nations, coordinated with the Department of State and other departments and agencies, are playing an important role in helping countries and jurisdictions address shortcomings in their AML and CFT regimes and bringing their regimes into conformity with international standards. Training is coordinated within the United States Government, which leverages multilateral organizations and bodies and international financial institutions to internationalize the conveyance of technical assistance.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(7) In fulfilling its duties in advancing incorporation of AML and CFT standards into the IFIs as part of the IFIs&apos; work on protecting the integrity of the international monetary system, the Department of the Treasury, under the guidance of the Secretary of the Treasury, has effectively brought together all of the key United States Government agencies. In particular, United States Government agencies continue to work together to foster broad support for this important undertaking in various multilateral fora, and United States Government agencies recognize the need for close coordination and communication within our own Government.</p>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(b) <cap-smallcap>Sense of Congress Regarding Success in Multilateral Organizations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the sense of Congress that the Secretary of the Treasury should continue to promote the dissemination of international AML and CFT standards, and to press for full implementation of the FATF 40 + 8 Recommendations by all countries in order to curb financial risks and hinder terrorist financing around the globe. The efforts of the Secretary <!-- PDFPage:434 -->in this regard should include, where necessary or appropriate, multilateral action against countries whose counter-money laundering regimes and efforts against the financing of terrorism fall below recognized international standards.</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(2) money laundering, and the defects in financial transparency on which money launderers rely, are critical to the financing of global terrorism and the provision of funds for terrorist attacks;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(3) money launderers subvert legitimate financial mechanisms and banking relationships by using them as protective covering for the movement of criminal proceeds and the financing of crime and terrorism, and, by so doing, can threaten the safety of United States citizens and undermine the integrity of United States financial institutions and of the global financial and trading systems upon which prosperity and growth depend;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(4) certain jurisdictions outside of the United States that offer &apos;offshore&apos; banking and related facilities designed to provide anonymity, coupled with weak financial supervisory and enforcement regimes, provide essential tools to disguise ownership and movement of criminal funds derived from, or used to commit, offenses ranging from narcotics trafficking, terrorism, arms smuggling, and trafficking in human beings, to financial frauds that prey on law-abiding citizens;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(5) transactions involving such offshore jurisdictions make it difficult for law enforcement officials and regulators to follow the trail of money earned by criminals, organized international criminal enterprises, and global terrorist organizations;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(6) correspondent banking facilities are one of the banking mechanisms susceptible in some circumstances to manipulation by foreign banks to permit the laundering of funds by hiding the identity of real parties in interest to financial transactions;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(7) private banking services can be susceptible to manipulation by money launderers, for example corrupt foreign government officials, particularly if those services include the creation of offshore accounts and facilities for large personal funds transfers to channel funds into accounts around the globe;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(8) United States anti-money laundering efforts are impeded by outmoded and inadequate statutory provisions that make investigations, prosecutions, and forfeitures more difficult, particularly in cases in which money laundering involves foreign persons, foreign banks, or foreign countries;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(9) the ability to mount effective counter-measures to international money launderers requires national, as well as bilateral and multilateral action, using tools specially designed for that effort; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(10) the Basle Committee on Banking Regulation and Supervisory Practices and the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering, of both of which the United States is a member, have each adopted international anti-money laundering principles and recommendations.</p>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(b) <cap-smallcap>Purposes</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The purposes of this title [see Short Title of 2001 Amendment note set out under section 5301 of this title] are&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(1) to increase the strength of United States measures to prevent, detect, and prosecute international money laundering and the financing of terrorism;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(2) to ensure that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&quot;(A) banking transactions and financial relationships and the conduct of such transactions and relationships, do not contravene the purposes of subchapter II of chapter 53 of title 31, United States Code, section 21 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act [12 U.S.C. 1829b], or chapter 2 of title I of Public Law 91&ndash;508 (84 Stat. 1116) [12 U.S.C. 1951 et seq.], or facilitate the evasion of any such provision; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&quot;(B) the purposes of such provisions of law continue to be fulfilled, and such provisions of law are effectively and efficiently administered;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(3) to strengthen the provisions put into place by the Money Laundering Control Act of 1986 (18 U.S.C. 981 note) [see Short Title of 1986 Amendment note set out under section 981 of Title 18, Crimes and Criminal Procedure], especially with respect to crimes by non-United States nationals and foreign financial institutions;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(4) to provide a clear national mandate for subjecting to special scrutiny those foreign jurisdictions, financial institutions operating outside of the United States, and classes of international transactions or types of accounts that pose particular, identifiable opportunities for criminal abuse;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(5) to provide the Secretary of the Treasury (in this title referred to as the &apos;Secretary&apos;) with broad discretion, subject to the safeguards provided by the Administrative Procedure Act under title 5, United States Code [5 U.S.C. 551 et seq., 701 et seq.], to take measures tailored to the particular money laundering problems presented by specific foreign jurisdictions, financial institutions operating outside of the United States, and classes of international transactions or types of accounts;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(6) to ensure that the employment of such measures by the Secretary permits appropriate opportunity for comment by affected financial institutions;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(7) to provide guidance to domestic financial institutions on particular foreign jurisdictions, financial <!-- PDFPage:435 -->institutions operating outside of the United States, and classes of international transactions or types of accounts that are of primary money laundering concern to the United States Government;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(8) to ensure that the forfeiture of any assets in connection with the anti-terrorist efforts of the United States permits for adequate challenge consistent with providing due process rights;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(9) to clarify the terms of the safe harbor from civil liability for filing suspicious activity reports;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(10) to strengthen the authority of the Secretary to issue and administer geographic targeting orders, and to clarify that violations of such orders or any other requirement imposed under the authority contained in chapter 2 of title I of Public Law 91&ndash;508 [12 U.S.C. 1951 et seq.] and subchapter II of chapter 53 of title 31, United States Code, may result in criminal and civil penalties;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(11) to ensure that all appropriate elements of the financial services industry are subject to appropriate requirements to report potential money laundering transactions to proper authorities, and that jurisdictional disputes do not hinder examination of compliance by financial institutions with relevant reporting requirements;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(12) to strengthen the ability of financial institutions to maintain the integrity of their employee population; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(13) to strengthen measures to prevent the use of the United States financial system for personal gain by corrupt foreign officials and to facilitate the repatriation of any stolen assets to the citizens of countries to whom such assets belong.&quot;</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(1) The Congress established the currency transaction reporting requirements in 1970 because the Congress found then that such reports have a high degree of usefulness in criminal, tax, and regulatory investigations and proceedings and the usefulness of such reports has only increased in the years since the requirements were established.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(2) In 1994, in response to reports and testimony that excess amounts of currency transaction reports were interfering with effective law enforcement, the Congress reformed the currency transaction report exemption requirements to provide&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&quot;(A) mandatory exemptions for certain reports that had little usefulness for law enforcement, such as cash transfers between depository institutions and cash deposits from government agencies; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&quot;(B) discretionary authority for the Secretary of the Treasury to provide exemptions, subject to criteria and guidelines established by the Secretary, for financial institutions with regard to regular business customers that maintain accounts at an institution into which frequent cash deposits are made.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(3) Today there is evidence that some financial institutions are not utilizing the exemption system, or are filing reports even if there is an exemption in effect, with the result that the volume of currency transaction reports is once again interfering with effective law enforcement.</p>

<p class="note-body-2em">&quot;(B) methods for improving financial institution utilization of the statutory exemption provisions as a way of reducing the submission of currency transaction reports that have little or no value for law enforcement purposes, including improvements in the systems in effect at financial institutions for regular review of the exemption procedures used at the institution and the training of personnel in its effective use.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(2) <cap-smallcap>Report required</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of the Treasury shall submit a report to the Congress before the end of the 1-year period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act [Oct. 26, 2001] containing the findings and conclusions of the Secretary with regard to the study required under subsection (a), and such recommendations for legislative or administrative action as the Secretary determines to be appropriate.&quot;</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Bulk Cash Smuggling Into or Out of the United States</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 107&ndash;56, title III, &sect;371(a), (b), Oct. 26, 2001, 115 Stat. 336, 337, provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(1) Effective enforcement of the currency reporting requirements of subchapter II of chapter 53 of title 31, United States Code, and the regulations prescribed under such subchapter, has forced drug dealers and other criminals engaged in cash-based businesses to avoid using traditional financial institutions.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(2) In their effort to avoid using traditional financial institutions, drug dealers and other criminals are forced to move large quantities of currency in bulk form to and through the airports, border crossings, and other ports of entry where the currency can be smuggled out of the United States and placed in a foreign financial institution or sold on the black market.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(3) The transportation and smuggling of cash in bulk form may now be the most common form of money laundering, and the movement of large sums of cash is one of the most reliable warning signs of drug trafficking, terrorism, money laundering, racketeering, tax evasion and similar crimes.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(4) The intentional transportation into or out of the United States of large amounts of currency or monetary instruments, in a manner designed to circumvent the mandatory reporting provisions of subchapter II of chapter 53 of title 31, United States Code,, [sic] is the equivalent of, and creates the same harm as, the smuggling of goods.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(5) The arrest and prosecution of bulk cash smugglers are important parts of law enforcement's effort to stop the laundering of criminal proceeds, but the couriers who attempt to smuggle the cash out of the United States are typically low-level employees of large criminal organizations, and thus are easily replaced. Accordingly, only the confiscation of the smuggled bulk cash can effectively break the cycle of criminal activity of which the laundering of the bulk cash is a critical part.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(6) The current penalties for violations of the currency reporting requirements are insufficient to provide a deterrent to the laundering of criminal proceeds. In particular, in cases where the only criminal violation under current law is a reporting offense, the law does not adequately provide for the confiscation of smuggled currency. In contrast, if the smuggling of bulk cash were itself an offense, the cash could be confiscated as the corpus delicti of the smuggling offense.</p>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(b) <cap-smallcap>Purposes</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The purposes of this section [enacting this section] are&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(1) to make the act of smuggling bulk cash itself a criminal offense;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(2) to authorize forfeiture of any cash or instruments of the smuggling offense; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(3) to emphasize the seriousness of the act of bulk cash smuggling.&quot;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Whether the area is a key transportation hub with any international ports or airports or an extensive highway system.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Internet gambling is primarily funded through personal use of payment system instruments, credit cards, and wire transfers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The National Gambling Impact Study Commission in 1999 recommended the passage of legislation to prohibit wire transfers to Internet gambling sites or the banks which represent such sites.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Internet gambling is a growing cause of debt collection problems for insured depository institutions and the consumer credit industry.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) New mechanisms for enforcing gambling laws on the Internet are necessary because traditional law enforcement mechanisms are often inadequate for enforcing gambling prohibitions or regulations on the Internet, especially where such gambling crosses State or national borders.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Rule of Construction</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;No provision of this subchapter shall be construed as altering, limiting, or extending any Federal or State law or Tribal-State compact prohibiting, permitting, or regulating gambling within the United States.</p>
