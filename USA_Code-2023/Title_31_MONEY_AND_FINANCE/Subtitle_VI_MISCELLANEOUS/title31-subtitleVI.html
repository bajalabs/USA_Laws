<p class="statutory-body">(a) If a person is required under a law of the United States to give a surety bond, the person may give an eligible obligation as security instead of a surety bond. The obligation shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) be given to the official having authority to approve the surety bond;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, have a market value that is equal to or greater than the amount of the required surety bond; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) authorize the official receiving the obligation to collect or sell the obligation if the person defaults on a required condition.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) An official receiving an eligible obligation under subsection (a) of this section may deposit it with&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the Secretary of the Treasury;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a Federal reserve bank; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) a depositary designated by the Secretary.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary, bank, or depositary shall issue a receipt that describes the obligation deposited.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Using an eligible obligation instead of a surety bond for security is the same as using&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a personal or corporate surety bond;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a certified check;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) a bank draft;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) a post office money order; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) cash.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) When security is no longer required, an eligible obligation given instead of a surety bond shall be returned to the person giving the obligation. If a person, supplying labor or material to a contractor defaulting under sections 3131 and 3133 of title 40, files with the United States Government the application and affidavit provided under section 3133(a) of title 40, the Government&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) may return to the contractor the eligible obligation given as security (or proceeds of the eligible obligation given) under sections 3131 and 3133 of title 40 only after the 90-day period for bringing a civil action under section 3133(b) of title 40; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if a civil action is brought in the 90-day period, shall hold the eligible obligation or the proceeds subject to the order of the court having jurisdiction of the action.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) This section does not affect the&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) priority of a claim of the Government against an eligible obligation given under this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) right or remedy of the Government for default on an obligation provided under&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) sections 3131 and 3133 of title 40; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) this section;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) authority of a court over an eligible obligation given as security in a civil action; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) authority of an official of the Government authorized by another law to receive an eligible obligation as security.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) To avoid frequent substitution of eligible obligations, the Secretary may prescribe regulations limiting the effect of this section to an eligible obligation maturing more than one year after the date the obligation is given as security.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) Beginning with fiscal year 1999, the performance plans required under section 1115 may include proposals to waive administrative procedural requirements and controls, including specification of personnel staffing levels, limitations on compensation or remuneration, and prohibitions or restrictions on funding transfers among budget object classification 20 and subclassifications 11, 12, 31, and 32 of each annual budget submitted under section 1105, in return for specific individual or organization accountability to achieve a performance goal. In preparing and submitting the performance plan under section 1105(a)(29),<sup><a href="#9703_1_target" name="9703_1">1</a></sup> the Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall review and may approve any proposed waivers. A waiver shall take effect at the beginning of the fiscal year for which the waiver is approved.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Any such proposal under subsection (a) shall describe the anticipated effects on performance resulting from greater managerial or organizational flexibility, discretion, and authority, and shall quantify the expected improvements in performance resulting from any waiver. The expected improvements shall be compared to current actual performance, and to the projected level of performance that would be achieved independent of any waiver.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Any proposal waiving limitations on compensation or remuneration shall precisely express the monetary change in compensation or remuneration amounts, such as bonuses or awards, that shall result from meeting, exceeding, or failing to meet performance goals.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Any proposed waiver of procedural requirements or controls imposed by an agency (other than the proposing agency or the Office of Management and Budget) may not be included in a performance plan unless it is endorsed by the agency that established the requirement, and the endorsement included in the proposing agency's performance plan.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:586 --><p class="statutory-body">(e) A waiver shall be in effect for one or two years as specified by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget in approving the waiver. A waiver may be renewed for a subsequent year. After a waiver has been in effect for three consecutive years, the performance plan prepared under section 1115 may propose that a waiver, other than a waiver of limitations on compensation or remuneration, be made permanent.</p>
