<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 13776, Feb. 9, 2017, 82 F.R. 10699, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to reduce crime and restore public safety to communities across the Nation, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>

<p class="note-body">(iii) identify deficiencies in existing laws that have made them less effective in reducing crime and propose new legislation that could be enacted to improve public safety and reduce crime;</p>
<p class="note-body">(iv) evaluate the availability and adequacy of crime-related data and identify measures that could improve data collection in a manner that will aid in the understanding of crime trends and in the reduction of crime; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(v) conduct any other studies and develop any other recommendations as directed by the Attorney General.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) The Task Force shall meet as required by the Attorney General and shall be dissolved once it has accomplished the objectives set forth in subsection (c) of this section, as determined by the Attorney General.</p>

The structure of the report is left to the discretion of the Attorney General. In its first report to the President and in any subsequent reports, the Task Force shall summarize its findings and recommendations under subsections (c)(ii) through (c)(v) of this section.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <i>General Provisions</i>. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;60101. Findings</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Increasingly, States are turning to private prisoner transport companies as an alternative to their own personnel or the United States Marshals Service when transporting violent prisoners.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The transport process can last for days if not weeks, as violent prisoners are dropped off and picked up at a network of hubs across the country.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Escapes by violent prisoners during transport by private prisoner transport companies have occurred.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Oversight by the Attorney General is required to address these problems.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) While most governmental entities may prefer to use, and will continue to use, fully trained and sworn law enforcement officers when transporting violent prisoners, fiscal or logistical concerns may make the use of highly specialized private prisoner transport companies an option. Nothing in sections 60101 to 60104 of this title should be construed to mean that governmental entities should contract with private prisoner transport companies to move violent prisoners; however when a government entity opts to use a private prisoner transport company to move violent prisoners, then the company should be subject to regulation in order to enhance public safety.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Minimum standards for the number of personnel that must supervise violent prisoners.

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;60305. Evaluations by Inspector General and administrative remedies</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Evaluation by Inspector General</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">As soon as practicable after the end of the first fiscal year for which a State receives funds under a grant made under this chapter, the Inspector General of the Department of Justice (in this section referred to as the &quot;Inspector General&quot;) shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) submit to the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives and the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate a report evaluating the compliance by the State with the terms and conditions of the grant; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if the Inspector General concludes that the State is not in compliance with the terms and conditions of the grant, specify any deficiencies and make recommendations to the Attorney General for corrective action.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:669 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Priority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In conducting evaluations under this subsection, the Inspector General shall give priority to States that the Inspector General determines, based on information submitted by the State and other comments provided by any other person, to be at the highest risk of noncompliance.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Determination for statutory procedure States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For each State that employs a statutory procedure described in section 60301(e)(1)(C) of this title, the Inspector General shall submit to the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives and the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate, not later than the end of the first fiscal year for which such State receives funds, a determination as to whether the State is in substantial compliance with the requirements of the applicable State statute.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Comments from public</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Inspector General shall receive and consider comments from any member of the public regarding any State's compliance with the terms and conditions of a grant made under this chapter. To facilitate the receipt of such comments, the Inspector General shall maintain on its website a form that any member of the public may submit, either electronically or otherwise, providing comments. The Inspector General shall give appropriate consideration to all such public comments in reviewing reports submitted under section 60304 of this title or in establishing the priority for conducting evaluations under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Administrative review</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Comment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Upon the submission of a report under subsection (a)(1) or a determination under subsection (a)(3), the Attorney General shall provide the State with an opportunity to comment regarding the findings and conclusions of the report or the determination.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Corrective action plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Attorney General, after reviewing a report under subsection (a)(1) or a determination under subsection (a)(3), determines that a State is not in compliance with the terms and conditions of the grant, the Attorney General shall consult with the appropriate State authorities to enter into a plan for corrective action. If the State does not agree to a plan for corrective action that has been approved by the Attorney General within 90 days after the submission of the report under subsection (a)(1) or the determination under subsection (a)(3), the Attorney General shall, within 30 days, issue guidance to the State regarding corrective action to bring the State into compliance.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Report to Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Not later than 90 days after the earlier of the implementation of a corrective action plan or the issuance of guidance under paragraph (2), the Attorney General shall submit a report to the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives and the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate as to whether the State has taken corrective action and is in compliance with the terms and conditions of the grant.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Penalties for noncompliance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the State fails to take the prescribed corrective action under subsection (b) and is not in compliance with the terms and conditions of the grant, the Attorney General shall discontinue all further funding under sections 60301 and 60302 of this title and require the State to return the funds granted under such sections for that fiscal year. Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent a State which has been subject to penalties for noncompliance from reapplying for a grant under this chapter in another fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Periodic reports</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">During the grant period, the Inspector General shall periodically review the compliance of each State with the terms and conditions of the grant.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Administrative costs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not less than 2.5 percent of the funds appropriated to carry out this chapter for each of fiscal years 2005 through 2009 shall be made available to the Inspector General for purposes of carrying out this section. Such sums shall remain available until expended.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Special rule for &quot;statutory procedure&quot; States not in substantial compliance with statutory procedures</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a State that employs a statutory procedure described in section 60301(e)(1)(C) of this title, if the Inspector General submits a determination under subsection (a)(3) that the State is not in substantial compliance with the requirements of the applicable State statute, then for the period beginning with the date on which that determination was submitted and ending on the date on which the Inspector General determines that the State is in substantial compliance with the requirements of that statute, the funds awarded under this chapter shall be allocated solely for the uses described in section 60301 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Rule of construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The requirements of this subsection apply in addition to, and not instead of, the other requirements of this section.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;60501. Purposes; findings</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purposes of the Act are&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to break the cycle of criminal recidivism, increase public safety, and help States, local units of government, and Indian Tribes, better address the growing population of criminal offenders who return to their communities and commit new crimes;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to rebuild ties between offenders and their families, while the offenders are incarcerated and after reentry into the community, to promote stable families and communities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to encourage the development and support of, and to expand the availability of, evidence-based programs that enhance public safety and reduce recidivism, such as substance abuse treatment, alternatives to incarceration, and comprehensive reentry services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to protect the public and promote law-abiding conduct by providing necessary services to offenders, while the offenders are incarcerated and after reentry into the community, in a manner that does not confer luxuries or privileges upon such offenders;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to assist offenders reentering the community from incarceration to establish a self-sustaining and law-abiding life by providing sufficient transitional services for as short of a period as practicable, not to exceed one year, unless a longer period is specifically determined to be necessary by a medical or other appropriate treatment professional; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) to provide offenders in prisons, jails or juvenile facilities with educational, literacy, vocational, and job placement services to facilitate re-entry into the community.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) In 2002, over 7,000,000 people were incarcerated in Federal or State prisons or in local jails. Nearly 650,000 people are released from Federal and State incarceration into communities nationwide each year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) There are over 3,200 jails throughout the United States, the vast majority of which are operated by county governments. Each year, these jails will release more than 10,000,000 people back into the community.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Recent studies indicate that over 2/3 of released State prisoners are expected to be rearrested for a felony or serious misdemeanor within 3 years after release.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:671 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, expenditures on corrections alone increased from $9,000,000,000 in 1982, to $59,600,000,000 in 2002. These figures do not include the cost of arrest and prosecution, nor do they take into account the cost to victims.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The Serious and Violent Offender Reentry Initiative (SVORI) provided $139,000,000 in funding for State governments to develop and implement education, job training, mental health treatment, and substance abuse treatment for serious and violent offenders. This Act seeks to build upon the innovative and successful State reentry programs developed under the SVORI, which terminated after fiscal year 2005.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Between 1991 and 1999, the number of children with a parent in a Federal or State correctional facility increased by more than 100 percent, from approximately 900,000 to approximately 2,000,000. According to the Bureau of Prisons, there is evidence to suggest that inmates who are connected to their children and families are more likely to avoid negative incidents and have reduced sentences.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Released prisoners cite family support as the most important factor in helping them stay out of prison. Research suggests that families are an often underutilized resource in the reentry process.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) Approximately 100,000 juveniles (ages 17 years and under) leave juvenile correctional facilities, State prison, or Federal prison each year. Juveniles released from secure confinement still have their likely prime crime years ahead of them. Juveniles released from secure confinement have a recidivism rate ranging from 55 to 75 percent. The chances that young people will successfully transition into society improve with effective reentry and aftercare programs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) Studies have shown that between 15 percent and 27 percent of prisoners expect to go to homeless shelters upon release from prison.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) Fifty-seven percent of Federal and 70 percent of State inmates used drugs regularly before going to prison, and the Bureau of Justice statistics report titled &quot;Trends in State Parole, 1990&ndash;2000&quot; estimates the use of drugs or alcohol around the time of the offense that resulted in the incarceration of the inmate at as high as 84 percent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) Family-based treatment programs have proven results for serving the special populations of female offenders and substance abusers with children. An evaluation by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration of family-based treatment for substance-abusing mothers and children found that 6 months after such treatment, 60 percent of the mothers remained alcohol and drug free, and drug-related offenses declined from 28 percent to 7 percent. Additionally, a 2003 evaluation of residential family-based treatment programs revealed that 60 percent of mothers remained clean and sober 6 months after treatment, criminal arrests declined by 43 percent, and 88 percent of the children treated in the program with their mothers remained stabilized.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) A Bureau of Justice Statistics analysis indicated that only 33 percent of Federal inmates and 36 percent of State inmates had participated in residential in-patient treatment programs for alcohol and drug abuse 12 months before their release. Further, over one-third of all jail inmates have some physical or mental disability and 25 percent of jail inmates have been treated at some time for a mental or emotional problem.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(13) State Substance Abuse Agency Directors, also known as Single State Authorities, manage the publicly funded substance abuse prevention and treatment system of the Nation. Single State Authorities are responsible for planning and implementing statewide systems of care that provide clinically appropriate substance abuse services. Given the high rate of substance use disorders among offenders reentering our communities, successful reentry programs require close interaction and collaboration with each Single State Authority as the program is planned, implemented, and evaluated.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(14) According to the National Institute of Literacy, 70 percent of all prisoners function at the lowest literacy levels.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(15) Less than 32 percent of State prison inmates have a high school diploma or a higher level of education, compared to 82 percent of the general population.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(16) Approximately 38 percent of inmates who completed 11 years or less of school were not working before entry into prison.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(17) The percentage of State prisoners participating in educational programs decreased by more than 8 percent between 1991 and 1997, despite growing evidence of how educational programming while incarcerated reduces recidivism.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(18) The National Institute of Justice has found that 1 year after release, up to 60 percent of former inmates are not employed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(19) Transitional jobs programs have proven to help people with criminal records to successfully return to the workplace and to the community, and therefore can reduce recidivism.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The head of an agency shall review the case file regarding a cold case murder upon written application by one designated person to determine if a full reinvestigation would result in either the identification of probative investigative leads or a likely perpetrator.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The review under subsection (a) shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) an analysis of what investigative steps or follow-up steps may have been missed in the initial investigation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) an assessment of whether witnesses should be interviewed or reinterviewed;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) an examination of physical evidence to see if all appropriate forensic testing and analysis was performed in the first instance or if additional testing might produce information relevant to the investigation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) an update of the case file using the most current investigative standards as of the date of the review to the extent it would help develop probative leads.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Certification in lieu of review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any case in which a written application for review has been received under this chapter by the agency, review shall be unnecessary where the case does not satisfy the criteria for a cold case murder. In such a case, the head of the agency shall issue a written certification, with a copy provided to the designated person that made the application under subsection (a), stating that final review is not necessary because all probative investigative leads have been exhausted or that a likely perpetrator will not be identified.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Reviewer</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A review required under subsection (a) shall not be conducted by a person who previously investigated the murder at issue.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Acknowledgment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The agency shall provide in writing to the applicant as soon as reasonably possible&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) confirmation of the agency's receipt of the application under subsection (a); and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Prohibition on multiple concurrent reviews</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Only one case review shall be undertaken at any one time with respect to the same cold case murder victim.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:684 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Time limit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not later than 6 months after the receipt of the written application submitted pursuant to subsection (a), the agency shall conclude its case file review and reach a conclusion about whether or not a full reinvestigation under section 60903 of this title is warranted.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Extensions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The agency may extend the time limit under subsection (g) once for a period of time not to exceed 6 months if the agency makes a finding that the number of case files to be reviewed make it impracticable to comply with such limit without unreasonably taking resources from other law enforcement activities.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Actions subsequent to waiver</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For cases for which the time limit in subsection (g) is extended, the agency shall provide notice and an explanation of its reasoning to one designated person who filed the written application pursuant to this section.</p>
