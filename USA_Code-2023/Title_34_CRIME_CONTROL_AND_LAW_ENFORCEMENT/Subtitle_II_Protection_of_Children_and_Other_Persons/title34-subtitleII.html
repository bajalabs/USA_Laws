<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) To develop, strengthen, and implement campus policies, protocols, and services that more effectively identify and respond to the crimes of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking, including the use of technology to commit these crimes, and to train campus administrators, campus security personnel, and all participants in the resolution process, including personnel from the Title IX coordinator's office, student conduct office, and campus disciplinary or judicial boards on such policies, protocols, and services that promote a prompt, fair, and impartial investigation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) To provide prevention and education programming about domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking, including technological abuse and reproductive and sexual coercion, that is age-appropriate, culturally relevant, ongoing, delivered in multiple venues on campus, accessible, promotes respectful nonviolent behavior as a social norm, and engages men and boys. Such programming should be developed in partnership or collaboratively with experts in intimate partner and sexual violence prevention and intervention.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) To develop, enlarge, or strengthen victim services programs and population specific services on the campuses of the institutions involved, including programs providing legal, medical, or psychological counseling, for victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking, and to improve delivery of victim assistance on campus. To the extent practicable, such an institution shall collaborate with any victim service providers in the community in which the institution is located. If appropriate victim services programs are not available in the community or are not accessible to students, the institution shall, to the extent practicable, provide a victim services program on campus or create a victim services program in collaboration with a community-based organization. The institution shall use not less than 20 percent of the funds made available through the grant for a victim services program provided in accordance with this paragraph, regardless of whether the services are provided by the institution <!-- PDFPage:442 -->or in coordination with community victim service providers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) To create, disseminate, or otherwise provide assistance and information about victims&apos; options on and off campus to bring disciplinary or other legal action, including assistance to victims in immigration matters.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) To develop, install, or expand data collection and communication systems, including computerized systems, linking campus security to the local law enforcement for the purpose of identifying and tracking arrests, protection orders, violations of protection orders, prosecutions, and convictions with respect to the crimes of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking on campus.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) To provide capital improvements (including improved lighting and communications facilities but not including the construction of buildings) on campuses to address the crimes of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) To support improved coordination among campus administrators, campus security personnel, and local law enforcement to reduce domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking on campus.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) To train campus personnel in how to use a victim-centered, trauma-informed interview technique, which means asking questions of a student or a campus employee who is reported to be a victim of sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, or stalking, in a manner that is focused on the experience of the reported victim, that does not judge or blame the reported victim for the alleged crime, and that is informed by evidence-based research on trauma response. To the extent practicable, campus personnel shall allow the reported victim to participate in a recorded interview and to receive a copy of the recorded interview.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) over 3,400,000 reports of suspected child abuse and neglect are made each year;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the investigation and prosecution of child abuse cases is extremely complex, involving numerous agencies and dozens of personnel;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) a key to a child victim healing from abuse is access to supportive and healthy families and communities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) traditionally, community agencies and professionals have different roles in the prevention, investigation, and intervention process;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) in such cases, too often the system does not pay sufficient attention to the needs and welfare of the child victim, aggravating the trauma that the child victim has already experienced;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) there is a national need to enhance coordination among community agencies and professionals involved in the intervention system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) multidisciplinary child abuse investigation and prosecution programs have been developed that increase the reporting of child abuse cases, reduce the trauma to the child victim, improve positive outcomes for the child, and increase the successful prosecution of child abuse offenders;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) such programs have proven effective, and with targeted Federal assistance, have expanded dramatically throughout the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) State chapters of children's advocacy center networks are needed to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) assist local communities in coordinating their multidisciplinary child abuse investigation, prosecution, and intervention services; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) provide oversight of, and training and technical assistance in, the effective delivery of evidence-informed programming, and operations of centers.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;20331. Findings and purpose</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a large number of juvenile and family courts are inundated with increasing numbers of cases due to increased reports of abuse and neglect, increasing drug-related maltreatment, and insufficient court resources;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the amendments made to the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.] by the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 make substantial demands on the courts handling abuse and neglect cases, but provide no assistance to the courts to meet those demands;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the Adoption&#160;<sup><a href="#20331_1_target" name="20331_1">1</a></sup> and Child Welfare Act of 1980 requires courts to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) determine whether the agency made reasonable efforts to prevent foster care placement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) approve voluntary nonjudicial placement; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) provide procedural safeguards for parents when their parent-child relationship is affected;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) social welfare agencies press the courts to meet such requirements, yet scarce resources often dictate that courts comply pro forma without undertaking the meaningful judicial inquiry contemplated by Congress in the Adoption&#160;<sup><a href="#20331_1_target" name="20331_1">1</a></sup> and Child Welfare Act of 1980;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) compliance with the Adoption&#160;<sup><a href="#20331_1_target" name="20331_1">1</a></sup> and Child Welfare Act of 1980 and overall improvements in the judicial response to abuse and neglect cases can best come about through action by top level court administrators and judges with administrative functions who understand the unique aspects of decisions required in child abuse and neglect cases; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the Adoption&#160;<sup><a href="#20331_1_target" name="20331_1">1</a></sup> and Child Welfare Act of 1980 provides financial incentives to train welfare agency staff to meet the requirements, but provides no resources to train judges.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of this subchapter is to provide expanded technical assistance and training to judicial personnel and attorneys, particularly personnel and practitioners in juvenile and family courts, to improve the judicial system's handling of child abuse and neglect cases with specific emphasis on the role of the courts in addressing reasonable efforts that can safely avoid unnecessary and unnecessarily prolonged foster care placement.</p>

By formal written agreement, the designated agency may be a non-Federal agency.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Immunity for good faith reporting and associated actions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">All persons who, acting in good faith, make a report by subsection (a), or otherwise provide information or assistance in connection with a report, investigation, or legal intervention pursuant to a report, shall be immune from civil and criminal liability arising out of such actions. There shall be a presumption that any such persons acted in good faith. If a person is sued because of the person's performance of one of the above functions, and the defendant prevails in the litigation, the court may order that the plaintiff pay the defendant's legal expenses. Immunity shall not be accorded to persons acting in bad faith.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Each agency of the Federal Government, and every facility operated by the Federal Government (or operated under contract with the Federal Government), that hires (or contracts for hire) individuals involved with the provision to children under the age of 18 of child care services shall assure that all existing and newly-hired employees undergo a criminal history background check. All existing staff shall receive such checks not later than May 29, 1991. Except as provided in subsection (b)(3), no additional staff shall be hired without a check having been completed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For the purposes of this section, the term &quot;child care services&quot; means child protective services (including the investigation of child abuse and neglect reports), social services, health and mental health care, child (day) care, education (whether or not directly involved in teaching), foster care, residential care, recreational or rehabilitative programs, and detention, correctional, or treatment services.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Criminal history check</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A background check required by subsection (a) shall be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) based on a set of the employee's fingerprints obtained by a law enforcement officer and on other identifying information;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) conducted through the Identification Division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and through the State criminal history repositories of all States that an employee or prospective employee lists as current and former residences in an employment application; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) initiated through the personnel programs of the applicable Federal agencies.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The results of the background check shall be communicated to the employing agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) An agency or facility described in subsection (a)(1) may hire a staff person provisionally prior to the completion of a background check if, at all times prior to receipt of the background check during which children are in the care of the person, the person is within the sight and under the supervision of a staff person with respect to whom a background check has been completed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Applicable criminal histories</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any conviction for a sex crime, an offense involving a child victim, or a drug felony, may be ground for denying employment or for dismissal <!-- PDFPage:480 -->of an employee in any of the positions listed in subsection (a)(2). In the case of an incident in which an individual has been charged with one of those offenses, when the charge has not yet been disposed of, an employer may suspend an employee from having any contact with children while on the job until the case is resolved. Conviction of a crime other than a sex crime may be considered if it bears on an individual's fitness to have responsibility for the safety and well-being of children.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Employment applications</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Employment applications for individuals who are seeking work for an agency of the Federal Government, or for a facility or program operated by (or through contract with) the Federal Government, in any of the positions listed in subsection (a)(1), shall contain a question asking whether the individual has ever been arrested for or charged with a crime involving a child, and if so requiring a description of the disposition of the arrest or charge. An application shall state that it is being signed under penalty of perjury, with the applicable Federal punishment for perjury stated on the application.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A Federal agency seeking a criminal history record check shall first obtain the signature of the employee or prospective employee indicating that the employee or prospective employee has been notified of the employer's obligation to require a record check as a condition of employment and the employee's right to obtain a copy of the criminal history report made available to the employing Federal agency and the right to challenge the accuracy and completeness of any information contained in the report.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Encouragement of voluntary criminal history checks for others who may have contact with children</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Federal agencies and facilities are encouraged to submit identifying information for criminal history checks on volunteers working in any of the positions listed in subsection (a) and on adult household members in places where child care or foster care services are being provided in a home.</p>

<p class="note-body">Ex Ord. No. 13903, Jan. 31, 2020, 85 F.R. 6721, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <i>Policy</i>. Human trafficking is a form of modern slavery. Throughout the United States and around the world, human trafficking tears apart communities, fuels criminal activity, and threatens the national security of the United States. It is estimated that millions of individuals are trafficked around the world each year&mdash;including into and within the United States. As the United States continues to lead the global fight against human trafficking, we must remain relentless in resolving to eradicate it in our cities, suburbs, rural communities, tribal lands, and on our transportation networks. Human trafficking in the United States takes many forms and can involve exploitation of both adults and children for labor and sex.</p>
<p class="note-body">Twenty-first century technology and the proliferation of the internet and mobile devices have helped facilitate the crime of child sex trafficking and other forms of child exploitation. Consequently, the number of reports to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children of online photos and videos of children being sexually abused is at record levels.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Federal Government is committed to preventing human trafficking and the online sexual exploitation of children. Effectively combating these crimes requires a comprehensive and coordinated response to prosecute human traffickers and individuals who sexually exploit children online, to protect and support victims of human trafficking and child exploitation, and to provide prevention education to raise awareness and help lower the incidence of human trafficking and child exploitation into, from, and within the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body">To this end, it shall be the policy of the executive branch to prioritize its resources to vigorously prosecute offenders, to assist victims, and to provide prevention education to combat human trafficking and online sexual exploitation of children.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <i>Strengthening Federal Responsiveness to Human Trafficking</i>. (a) The Domestic Policy Council shall commit one employee position to work on issues related to combating human trafficking occurring into, from, and within the United States and to coordinate with personnel in other components of the Executive Office of the President, including the Office of Economic Initiatives and the National Security Council, on such efforts. This position shall be filled by an employee of the executive branch detailed from the Department of Justice, the Department of Labor, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Transportation, or the Department of Homeland Security.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The Secretary of State, on behalf of the President's Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons, shall make available, online, a list of the Federal Government's resources to combat human trafficking, including resources to identify and report instances of human trafficking, to protect and support the victims of trafficking, and to provide public outreach and training.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) The Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall, in coordination and consistent with applicable law:</p>
<p class="note-body">(i) improve methodologies of estimating the prevalence of human trafficking, including in specific sectors or regions, and monitoring the impact of anti-trafficking efforts and publish such methodologies as appropriate; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(ii) establish estimates of the prevalence of human trafficking in the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <i>Prosecuting Human Traffickers and Individuals Who Exploit Children Online</i>. (a) The Attorney General, through the Federal Enforcement Working Group, in collaboration with the Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of Homeland Security, shall:</p>
<p class="note-body">(i) improve interagency coordination with respect to targeting traffickers, determining threat assessments, and sharing law enforcement intelligence to build on the Administration's commitment to the continued success of ongoing anti-trafficking enforcement initiatives, such as the Anti-Trafficking Coordination Team and the U.S.-Mexico Bilateral Human Trafficking Enforcement Initiatives; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(ii) coordinate activities, as appropriate, with the Task Force on Missing and Murdered American Indians and Alaska Natives as established by Executive Order 13898 of November 26, 2019 (Establishing the Task Force on Missing and Murdered American Indians and Alaska Natives) [25 U.S.C. 2801 note].</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security, and other heads of executive departments and agencies as appropriate, shall, within 180 days of the date of this order [Jan. 31, 2020], propose to the President, through the Director of the Domestic Policy Council, legislative and executive actions that would overcome information-sharing challenges and improve law enforcement's capabilities to detect in real-time the sharing of child sexual abuse material on the internet, including material referred to in Federal law as &quot;child pornography.&quot; Overcoming these challenges would allow law enforcement officials to more efficiently identify, protect, and rescue victims of online child sexual exploitation; investigate and prosecute alleged offenders; and eliminate the child sexual abuse material online.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <i>Protecting Victims of Human Trafficking and Child Exploitation</i>.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) children considered victims of &quot;child abuse and neglect&quot; and of &quot;sexual abuse&quot; under the application of section 5106g(b)(1) of title 42 because of being identified as being a victim or at risk of being a victim of a severe form of trafficking in persons; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) children over whom such agencies have responsibility for placement, care, or supervision and for whom there is reasonable cause to believe are, or are at risk of being a victim of 1 or more severe forms of trafficking in persons.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In this section:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Child</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &quot;child&quot; means an individual who has not attained 18 years of age or such older age as the State has elected under section 475(8) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 675(8)). At the option of an eligible State, such term may include an individual who has not attained 26 years of age.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Eligible State</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &quot;eligible State&quot; means a State that has not received more than 3 grants under this section and meets 1 or more of the following criteria:</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Elimination of third party control requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The State has eliminated or will eliminate any requirement relating to identification of a controlling third party who causes a child to engage in a commercial sex act in order for the child to be considered a victim of trafficking or a victim of 1 or more severe forms of trafficking in persons for purposes of accessing child welfare services and care.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Application of standard for human trafficking</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The State considers a child to be a victim of trafficking if the individual is a victim of a severe form of trafficking in persons, as described in subparagraph (A) of section 7102(11) of title 22.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Development and implementation of State child welfare plan protocols</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">The State has developed and implemented or will develop and implement a specialized protocol for responding to a child who is, or is at risk of being, a trafficking victim to ensure the response focuses on the child's specific safety needs as a victim of trafficking, and that includes the development and use of an alternative mechanism for investigating and responding to cases of child human trafficking in which the alleged offender is not the child's parent or caregiver without utilizing existing processes for investigating and responding to other forms of child abuse or neglect that require the filing of an abuse or neglect petition.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Indian tribe; tribal organization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &quot;Indian tribe&quot; and &quot;tribal organization&quot; have the meanings given those terms in section 5304 of title 25.</p>

In considering whether compliance with the requirements of this subchapter would likely violate the jurisdiction's constitution or an interpretation thereof by the jurisdiction's highest court, the Attorney General shall consult with the chief executive and chief legal officer of the jurisdiction concerning the jurisdiction's interpretation of the jurisdiction's constitution and rulings thereon by the jurisdiction's highest court.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Alternative procedures</h4>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) More than 200,000 Americans each year are victims of sexual assault, according to the Department of Justice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) In 2004, 1 American was sexually assaulted every 2.5 minutes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) One of every 6 women, and 1 of every 133 men, in America has been the victim of a completed or attempted rape, according to the Department of Justice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The Federal Bureau of Investigation ranks rape second in the hierarchy of violent crimes for its Uniform Crime Reports, trailing only murder.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The Federal Government, through the Victims of Crime Act [34 U.S.C. 20101 et seq.], Violence Against Women Act, and other laws, has long played a role in providing services to sexual assault victims and in seeking policies to increase the number of rapists brought to justice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Research suggests that sexual assault victims who receive counseling support are more likely to report their attack to the police and to participate in the prosecution of the offender.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Due in part to the combined efforts of law enforcement officials at the local, State, and <!-- PDFPage:521 -->Federal level, as well as the efforts of the Rape, Abuse &amp; Incest National Network (RAINN) and its affiliated rape crisis centers across the United States, sexual violence in America has fallen by more than half since 1994.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) RAINN, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation headquartered in the District of Columbia, has since 1994 provided help to victims of sexual assault and educated the public about sexual assault prevention, prosecution, and recovery.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) RAINN established and continues to operate the National Sexual Assault Hotline, a free, confidential telephone hotline that provides help, 24 hours a day, to victims nationally.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) More than 1,100 local rape crisis centers in the 50 States and the District of Columbia partner with RAINN and are members of the National Sexual Assault Hotline network (which has helped more than 970,000 people since its inception in 1994).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) To better serve victims of sexual assault, 80 percent of whom are under age 30 and 44 percent of whom are under age 18, RAINN will soon launch the National Sexual Assault Online Hotline, the web's first secure hotline service offering live help 24 hours a day.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) Congress and the Department of Justice have given RAINN funding to conduct its crucial work.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(13) RAINN is a national model of public/private partnership, raising private sector funds to match congressional appropriations and receiving extensive private in-kind support, including advanced technology provided by the communications and technology industries to launch the National Sexual Assault Hotline and the National Sexual Assault Online Hotline.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(14) Worth magazine selected RAINN as one of &quot;America's 100 Best Charities&quot;, in recognition of the organization's &quot;efficiency and effectiveness.&quot;.<sup><a href="#20985_1_target" name="20985_1">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(15) In fiscal year 2005, RAINN spent more than 91 cents of every dollar received directly on program services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(16) The demand for RAINN's services is growing dramatically, as evidenced by the fact that, in 2005, the National Sexual Assault Hotline helped 137,039 people, an all-time record.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(17) The programs sponsored by RAINN and its local affiliates have contributed to the increase in the percentage of victims who report their rape to law enforcement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(18) According to a recent poll, 92 percent of American women said that fighting sexual and domestic violence should be a top public policy priority (a higher percentage than chose health care, child care, or any other issue).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(19) Authorizing Federal funds for RAINN's national programs would promote continued progress with this interstate problem and would make a significant difference in the prosecution of rapists and the overall incidence of sexual violence.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Fugitive Safe Surrender is a program of the United States Marshals Service, in partnership with public, private, and faith-based organizations, which temporarily transforms a church into a courthouse, so fugitives can turn themselves in, in an atmosphere where they feel more comfortable to do so, and have nonviolent cases adjudicated immediately.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) In the 4-day pilot program in Cleveland, Ohio, over 800 fugitives turned themselves in. By contrast, a successful Fugitive Task Force sweep, conducted for 3 days after Fugitive Safe Surrender, resulted in the arrest of 65 individuals.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Fugitive Safe Surrender is safer for defendants, law enforcement, and innocent bystanders than needing to conduct a sweep.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Based upon the success of the pilot program, Fugitive Safe Surrender should be expanded to other cities throughout the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Establishment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The United States Marshals Service shall establish, direct, and coordinate a program (to be known as the &quot;Fugitive Safe Surrender Program&quot;), under which the United States Marshals Service shall apprehend Federal, State, and local fugitives in a safe, secure, and peaceful manner to be coordinated with law enforcement and community leaders in designated cities throughout the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Authorization of appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There are authorized to be appropriated to the United States Marshals Service to carry out this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) $3,000,000 for fiscal year 2007;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) $5,000,000 for fiscal year 2008; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) $8,000,000 for fiscal year 2009.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Other existing applicable law</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit any existing authority under any other provision of Federal or State law for law enforcement agencies to locate or apprehend fugitives through task forces or any other means.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Men who father children through rape should be prohibited from visiting or having custody of those children.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Thousands of rape-related pregnancies occur annually in the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) A substantial number of women choose to raise their child conceived through rape and, as a result, may face custody battles with their rapists.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Rape is one of the most under-prosecuted serious crimes, with estimates of criminal conviction occurring in less than 5 percent of rapes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The clear and convincing evidence standard is the most common standard for termination of parental rights among the 50 States, territories, and the District of Columbia.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The Supreme Court established that the clear and convincing evidence standard satisfies due process for allegations to terminate or restrict parental rights in Santosky v. Kramer (455 U.S. 745 (1982)).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Currently only 10 States have statutes allowing rape survivors to petition for the termination of parental rights of the rapist based on clear and convincing evidence that the child was conceived through rape.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) A rapist pursuing parental or custody rights causes the survivor to have continued interaction with the rapist, which can have traumatic psychological effects on the survivor, and can make it more difficult for her to recover.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) These traumatic effects on the mother can severely negatively impact her ability to raise a healthy child.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) Rapists may use the threat of pursuing custody or parental rights to coerce survivors into not prosecuting rape, or otherwise harass, intimidate, or manipulate them.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Megan Nicole Kanka, who was 7 years old, was abducted, sexually assaulted, and murdered in 1994, in the State of New Jersey by a violent predator living across the street from her home. Unbeknownst to Megan Kanka and her family, he had been convicted previously of a sex offense against a child.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) In 1996, Congress adopted Megan's Law (Public Law 104&ndash;145) as a means to encourage States to protect children by identifying the whereabouts of sex offenders and providing the means to monitor their activities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) In 2006, Congress passed the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006 (Public Law 109&ndash;248) to protect children and the public at large by establishing a comprehensive national system for the registration and notification to the public and law enforcement officers of convicted sex offenders.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Law enforcement reports indicate that known child-sex offenders are traveling internationally.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The commercial sexual exploitation of minors in child sex trafficking and pornography is a global phenomenon. The International Labour Organization has estimated that 1,8000,000&#160;<sup><a href="#21501_1_target" name="21501_1">1</a></sup> children worldwide are victims of child sex trafficking and pornography each year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Child sex tourism, where an individual travels to a foreign country and engages in sexual activity with a child in that country, is a form of child exploitation and, where commercial, child sex trafficking.</p>
