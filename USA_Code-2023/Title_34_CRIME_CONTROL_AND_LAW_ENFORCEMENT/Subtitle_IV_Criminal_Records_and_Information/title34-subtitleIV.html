<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A State may have in effect procedures (established by State statute or regulation) that require qualified entities designated by the State to contact an authorized agency of the State to request a nationwide background check for the purpose of determining whether a covered individual has been convicted of a crime that bears upon the covered individual's fitness to have responsibility for the safety and well-being of children, the elderly, or individuals with disabilities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The authorized agency shall access and review State and Federal criminal history records through the national criminal history background check system and shall make reasonable efforts to respond to the inquiry within 15 business days.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) The Attorney General shall establish a program, in accordance with this section, to provide qualified entities located in States that do not have in effect procedures described in paragraph (1), or qualified entities located in States that do not prohibit the use of the program established under this paragraph, with access to national criminal history background checks on, and criminal history reviews of, covered individuals. In any case where the use of a Federal national criminal history background check program is required pursuant to Federal law as of the effective date of this subparagraph, the program under this subparagraph may not be used.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A qualified entity described in subparagraph (A) may submit to the appropriate designated entity a request for a national criminal history background check on, and a criminal history review of, a covered individual. Qualified entities making a request under this paragraph shall comply with the guidelines set forth in subsection (b), and with any additional applicable procedures set forth by the Attorney General or by the State in which the entity is located.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Guidelines</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The procedures established under subsection (a) shall require&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) that no qualified entity may request a background check of a covered individual under subsection (a) unless the covered individual first provides a set of fingerprints and completes and signs a statement that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) contains the name, address, and date of birth appearing on a valid identification document (as defined in section 1028 of title 18) of the covered individual;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the covered individual has not been convicted of a crime and, if the covered individual has been convicted of a crime, contains a description of the crime and the particulars of the conviction;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) notifies the covered individual of the covered individual's rights under paragraph (2); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) notifies the covered individual that prior to the completion of the background check the qualified entity may choose to deny the covered individual access to a person to whom the qualified entity provides care;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) that the State, or in a State that does not have in effect procedures described in subsection (a)(1), the designated entity, ensures that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) each covered individual who is the subject of a background check under subsection (a) is entitled to obtain a copy of any background check report;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) each covered individual who is the subject of a background check under subsection (a) is provided a process by which the covered individual may appeal the results of the background check to challenge the accuracy or completeness of the information contained in the background report of the covered individual and obtain a prompt determination as to the validity of such challenge before a final determination is made by the authorized agency;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C)(i) each covered individual described in subparagraph (B) is given notice of the opportunity to appeal;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) each covered individual described in subparagraph (B) will receive instructions on how to complete the appeals process if the covered individual wishes to challenge the accuracy or completeness of the information contained in the background report of the covered individual; and&#160;<sup><a href="#40102_1_target" name="40102_1">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) the appeals process is completed in a timely manner for each covered individual described in subparagraph (B);&#160;<sup><a href="#40102_2_target" name="40102_2">2</a></sup></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) the appeals process is consistent with title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e et seq.); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) an authorized agency, upon receipt of a background check report lacking disposition data, shall conduct research in whatever State and local recordkeeping systems are available in order to obtain complete data;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) that an authorized agency or designated entity, as applicable,,<sup><a href="#40102_3_target" name="40102_3">3</a></sup> upon receipt of a background check report lacking disposition data, shall conduct research in whatever State and <!-- PDFPage:581 -->local recordkeeping systems are available in order to obtain complete data;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) that the authorized agency or designated entity, as applicable, shall make a determination whether the covered individual has been convicted of, or is under pending indictment for, a crime that bears upon the covered individual's fitness to have responsibility for the safety and well-being of children, the elderly, or individuals with disabilities and shall convey that determination to the qualified entity; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) that any background check under subsection (a) and the results thereof shall be handled in accordance with the requirements of Public Law 92&ndash;544, except that this paragraph does not apply to any request by a qualified entity for a national criminal fingerprint background check pursuant to subsection (a)(3).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Regulations</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Attorney General shall, to the maximum extent possible, encourage the use of the best technology available in conducting background checks.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Liability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A qualified entity shall not be liable in an action for damages solely for failure to conduct a criminal background check on a covered individual, nor shall a State or political subdivision thereof nor any agency, officer or employee thereof,,<sup><a href="#40102_3_target" name="40102_3">3</a></sup> nor shall any designated entity nor any officer or employee thereof, be liable in an action for damages for the failure of a qualified entity (other than itself) to take action adverse to a covered individual who was the subject of a background check.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Fees</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) State program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a background check conducted pursuant to a State requirement adopted after December 20, 1993, conducted with fingerprints on a covered individual, the fees collected by authorized State agencies and the Federal Bureau of Investigation may not exceed the actual cost of the background check conducted with fingerprints.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Federal program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a national criminal history background check and criminal history review conducted pursuant to the procedures established pursuant to subsection (a)(3), the fees collected by a designated entity shall be set at a level that will ensure the recovery of the full costs of providing all such services. The designated entity shall remit the appropriate portion of such fee to the Attorney General, which amount is in accordance with the amount published in the Federal Register to be collected for the provision of a criminal history background check by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Ensuring fees do not discourage volunteers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A fee system under this subsection shall be established in a manner that ensures that fees to qualified entities for background checks do not discourage volunteers from participating in programs to care for children, the elderly, or individuals with disabilities. A fee charged to a qualified entity that is not organized under section 501(c)(3) of title 26 may not be less than the total sum of the costs of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the designated entity.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) National criminal history background check and criminal history review program</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) National criminal history background check</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Upon a designated entity receiving notice of a request submitted by a qualified entity pursuant to subsection (a)(3), the designated entity shall forward the request to the Attorney General, who shall, acting through the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, complete a fingerprint-based check of the national criminal history background check system, and provide the information received in response to such national criminal history background check to the appropriate designated entity. The designated entity may, upon request from a qualified entity, complete a check of a State criminal history database.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Criminal history review</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Designated entities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Attorney General shall designate, and enter into an agreement with, one or more entities to make determinations described in subparagraph (B). The Attorney General may not designate and enter into an agreement with a Federal agency under this subparagraph.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A designated entity shall, upon the receipt of the information described in paragraph (1), make a determination of fitness described in subsection (b)(4), using the criteria described in subparagraph (C).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Criminal history review criteria</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Attorney General shall, by rule, establish the criteria for use by designated entities in making a determination of fitness described in subsection (b)(4). Such criteria shall be based on the criteria established pursuant to section 108(a)(3)(G)(i) of the Prosecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to end the Exploitation of Children Today Act of 2003 (34 U.S.C. 40102 note) and section 9858f of title 42.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) both the Federal Bureau of Investigation and State criminal history record repositories maintain fingerprint-based criminal history records;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) such a compact will allow Federal and State records to be provided expeditiously to governmental and nongovernmental agencies that use such records in accordance with pertinent Federal and State law, while simultaneously enhancing the accuracy of the records and safeguarding the information contained therein from unauthorized disclosure or use.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Sense of Congress Regarding the Obligation of Grantee States to Ensure Access to Post-Conviction DNA Testing and Competent Counsel in Capital Cases</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 106&ndash;561, &sect;4, Dec. 21, 2000, 114 Stat. 2791, provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(1) over the past decade, deoxyribonucleic acid testing (referred to in this section as &apos;DNA testing&apos;) has emerged as the most reliable forensic technique for identifying criminals when biological material is left at a crime scene;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(2) because of its scientific precision, DNA testing can, in some cases, conclusively establish the guilt or innocence of a criminal defendant;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(3) in other cases, DNA testing may not conclusively establish guilt or innocence, but may have significant probative value to a finder of fact;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(4) DNA testing was not widely available in cases tried prior to 1994;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(5) new forensic DNA testing procedures have made it possible to get results from minute samples that could not previously be tested, and to obtain more informative and accurate results than earlier forms of forensic DNA testing could produce, resulting in some cases of convicted inmates being exonerated by new DNA tests after earlier tests had failed to produce definitive results;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(6) DNA testing can and has resulted in the post-conviction exoneration of more than 75 innocent men and women, including some under sentence of death;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(7) in more than a dozen cases, post-conviction DNA testing that has exonerated an innocent person has also enhanced public safety by providing evidence that led to the apprehension of the actual perpetrator;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(8) experience has shown that it is not unduly burdensome to make DNA testing available to inmates in appropriate cases;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(9) under current Federal and State law, it is difficult to obtain post-conviction DNA testing because of time limits on introducing newly discovered evidence;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(10) the National Commission on the Future of DNA Evidence, a Federal panel established by the Department of Justice and comprised of law enforcement, judicial, and scientific experts, has urged that post-conviction DNA testing be permitted in the relatively small number of cases in which it is appropriate, notwithstanding procedural rules that could be invoked to preclude such testing, and notwithstanding the inability of an inmate to pay for the testing;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(11) only a few States have adopted post-conviction DNA testing procedures;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(12) States have received millions of dollars in DNA-related grants, and more funding is needed to improve State forensic facilities and to reduce the nationwide backlog of DNA samples from convicted offenders and crime scenes that need to be tested or retested using upgraded methods;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(13) States that accept such financial assistance should not deny the promise of truth and justice for both sides of our adversarial system that DNA testing offers;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(14) post-conviction DNA testing and other post-conviction investigative techniques have shown that innocent people have been sentenced to death in this country;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(15) a constitutional error in capital cases is incompetent defense lawyers who fail to present important evidence that the defendant may have been innocent or does not deserve to be sentenced to death; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(16) providing quality representation to defendants facing loss of liberty or life is essential to fundamental due process and the speedy final resolution of judicial proceedings.</p>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(b) <cap-smallcap>Sense of Congress</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the sense of Congress that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(1) Congress should condition forensic science-related grants to a State or State forensic facility on the State's agreement to ensure post-conviction DNA testing in appropriate cases; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(2) Congress should work with the States to improve the quality of legal representation in capital cases through the establishment of standards that will assure the timely appointment of competent counsel with adequate resources to represent defendants in capital cases at each stage of the proceedings.&quot;</p>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 106&ndash;546, &sect;11, Dec. 19, 2000, 114 Stat. 2735, enacted provisions substantially identical to those enacted by Pub. L. 106&ndash;561, &sect;4, set out above.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Tracing of Firearms in Connection With Criminal Investigations</h4>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum of President of the United States, Jan. 16, 2013, 78 F.R. 4301, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies</p>
<p class="note-body">Reducing violent crime, and gun-related crime in particular, is a top priority of my Administration. A key <!-- PDFPage:621 -->component of this effort is ensuring that law enforcement agencies at all levels&mdash;Federal, State, and local&mdash;utilize those tools that have proven most effective. One such tool is firearms tracing, which significantly assists law enforcement in reconstructing the transfer and movement of seized or recovered firearms. Responsibility for conducting firearms tracing rests with the Department of Justice's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF). Over the years, firearms tracing has significantly assisted law enforcement in solving violent crimes and generating thousands of leads that may otherwise not have been available.</p>
<p class="note-body">Firearms tracing provides two principal benefits. First, tracing is an important investigative tool in individual cases, providing law enforcement agents with critical information that may lead to the apprehension of suspects, the recovery of other guns used in the commission of crimes, and the identification of potential witnesses, among other things. Second, analysis of tracing data in the aggregate provides valuable intelligence about local, regional, and national patterns relating to the movement and sources of guns used in the commission of crimes, which is useful for the effective deployment of law enforcement resources and development of enforcement strategies. Firearms tracing is a particularly valuable tool in detecting and investigating firearms trafficking, and has been deployed to help combat the pernicious problem of firearms trafficking across the Southwest border.</p>
<p class="note-body">The effectiveness of firearms tracing as a law enforcement intelligence tool depends on the quantity and quality of information and trace requests submitted to ATF. In fiscal year 2012, ATF processed approximately 345,000 crime-gun trace requests for thousands of domestic and international law enforcement agencies. The Federal Government can encourage State and local law enforcement agencies to take advantage of the benefits of tracing all recovered firearms, but Federal law enforcement agencies should have an obligation to do so. If Federal law enforcement agencies do not conscientiously trace every firearm taken into custody, they may not only be depriving themselves of critical information in specific cases, but may also be depriving all Federal, State, and local agencies of the value of complete information for aggregate analyses.</p>
<p class="note-body">Maximizing the effectiveness of firearms tracing, and the corresponding impact on combating violent crimes involving firearms, requires that Federal law enforcement agencies trace all recovered firearms taken into Federal custody in a timely and efficient manner.</p>
<p class="note-body">Therefore, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby direct the following:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <i>Firearms Tracing</i>. (a) Federal law enforcement agencies shall ensure that all firearms recovered after the date of this memorandum in the course of criminal investigations and taken into Federal custody are traced through ATF at the earliest time practicable. Federal law enforcement agencies, as well as other executive departments and agencies, are encouraged, to the extent practicable, to take steps to ensure that firearms recovered prior to the date of this memorandum in the course of criminal investigations and taken into Federal custody are traced through ATF.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Within 30 days of the date of this memorandum, ATF will issue guidance to Federal law enforcement agencies on submitting firearms trace requests.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Promoting Smart Gun Technology</h4>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum of President of the United States, Jan. 4, 2016, 81 F.R. 719, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum for the Secretary of Defense[,] the Attorney General[, and] the Secretary of Homeland Security</p>
<p class="note-body">For more than 20 years, the Federal Government has worked to keep guns out of the wrong hands through background checks. This critical effort in addressing gun violence has prevented more than two million prohibited firearms purchases from being completed. But tens of thousands of people are still injured or killed by firearms every year&mdash;in many cases by guns that were sold legally but then stolen, misused, or discharged accidentally. Developing and promoting technology that would help prevent these tragedies is an urgent priority.</p>
<p class="note-body">In 2013, I directed the Department of Justice to review the availability and most effective use of new gun safety technologies, such as devices requiring a scan of the owner's fingerprint before a gun can fire. In its report, the Department made clear that technological advancements in this area could help reduce accidental deaths and the use of stolen guns in criminal activities.</p>
<p class="note-body">Millions of dollars have already been invested to support research into a broad range of concepts for improving gun safety. We must all do our part to continue to advance this research and encourage its practical application, and it is possible to do so in a way that makes the public safer and is consistent with the Second Amendment. The Federal Government has a unique opportunity to do so, as it is the single largest purchaser of firearms in the country. Therefore, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby direct the following:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <i>Research and Development</i>. The Department of Defense, the Department of Justice, and the Department of Homeland Security (departments) shall, to the extent practicable and permitted by law, conduct or sponsor research into gun safety technology that would reduce the frequency of accidental discharge or unauthorized use of firearms, and improve the tracing of lost or stolen guns. Not later than 90 days after the date of this memorandum, the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall prepare jointly a report outlining a research and development strategy designed to expedite the real-world deployment of such technology for use in practice.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <i>Department Consideration of New Technology</i>. The departments shall, to the extent permitted by law, regularly (a) review the availability of the technology described in section 1, and (b) explore potential ways to further its use and development to more broadly improve gun safety. In connection with these efforts, the departments shall consult with other agencies that acquire firearms and take appropriate steps to consider whether including such technology in specifications for acquisition of firearms would be consistent with operational needs.</p>

<p class="note-body">(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;40902. Findings</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Approximately 916,000 individuals were prohibited from purchasing a firearm for failing a background check between November 30, 1998, (the date the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) began operating) and December 31, 2004.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) From November 30, 1998, through December 31, 2004, nearly 49,000,000 Brady background checks were processed through NICS.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Although most Brady background checks are processed through NICS in seconds, many background checks are delayed if the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) does not have automated access to complete information from the States concerning persons prohibited from possessing or receiving a firearm under Federal or State law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Nearly 21,000,000 criminal records are not accessible by NICS and millions of criminal records are missing critical data, such as arrest dispositions, due to data backlogs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The primary cause of delay in NICS background checks is the lack of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) updates and available State criminal disposition records; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) automated access to information concerning persons prohibited from possessing or receiving a firearm because of mental illness, restraining orders, or misdemeanor convictions for domestic violence.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Automated access to this information can be improved by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) computerizing information relating to criminal history, criminal dispositions, mental illness, restraining orders, and misdemeanor convictions for domestic violence; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) making such information available to NICS in a usable format.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Helping States to automate these records will reduce delays for law-abiding gun purchasers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) On March 12, 2002, the senseless shooting, which took the lives of a priest and a parishioner at the Our Lady of Peace Church in Lynbrook, New York, brought attention to the need to improve information-sharing that would enable Federal and State law enforcement agencies to conduct a complete background check on a potential firearm purchaser. The man who committed this double murder had a prior disqualifying mental health commitment and a restraining order against him, but passed a Brady background check because NICS did not have the necessary information to determine that he was ineligible to purchase a firearm under Federal or State law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) On April 16, 2007, a student with a history of mental illness at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University shot to death 32 students and faculty members, wounded 17 more, and then took his own life. The shooting, the deadliest campus shooting in United States history, renewed the need to improve information-sharing that would enable Federal and State law enforcement agencies to conduct complete background checks on potential firearms purchasers. In spite of a proven history of mental illness, the shooter was able to purchase the two firearms used in the shooting. Improved coordination between State and Federal authorities could have ensured that the shooter's disqualifying mental health information was available to NICS.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Improving Availability of Relevant Executive Branch Records to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System</h4>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum of President of the United States, Jan. 16, 2013, 78 F.R. 4297, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies</p>
<p class="note-body">Since it became operational in 1998, the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) has been an essential tool in the effort to ensure that individuals who are prohibited under Federal or State law from possessing firearms do not acquire them from Federal Firearms Licensees (FFLs). The ability of the NICS to determine quickly and effectively whether an individual is prohibited from possessing or receiving a firearm depends on the completeness and accuracy of the information made available to it by Federal, State, and tribal authorities.</p>
<p class="note-body">The NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 (NIAA) (Public Law 1107&ndash;180 [110&ndash;180]) was a bipartisan effort to strengthen the NICS by increasing the quantity and quality of relevant records from Federal, State, and tribal authorities accessible by the system. Among its requirements, the NIAA mandated that executive departments and agencies (agencies) provide relevant information, including criminal history records, certain adjudications related to the mental health of a person, and other information, to databases accessible by the NICS. Much progress has been made to identify information generated by agencies that is relevant to determining whether a person is prohibited from receiving or possessing firearms, but more must be done. Greater participation by agencies in identifying records they possess that are relevant to determining whether an individual is prohibited from possessing a firearm and a regularized process for submitting those records to the NICS will strengthen the accuracy and efficiency of the NICS, increasing public safety by keeping guns out of the hands of persons who cannot lawfully possess them.</p>
<p class="note-body">Therefore, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby direct the following:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <i>Improving the Availability of Records to the NICS</i>. (a) Within 45 days of the date of this memorandum, and consistent with the process described in section 3 of this memorandum, the Department of Justice (DOJ) shall issue guidance to agencies regarding the identification and sharing of relevant Federal records and their submission to the NICS.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:625 --><p class="note-body">(b) Within 60 days of issuance of guidance pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, agencies shall submit a report to DOJ advising whether they possess relevant records, as set forth in the guidance, and setting forth an implementation plan for making information in those records available to the NICS, consistent with applicable law.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) In accordance with the authority and responsibility provided to the Attorney General by the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act (Public Law 103&ndash;159), as amended, the Attorney General, consistent with the process described in section 3 of this memorandum, shall resolve any disputes concerning whether agency records are relevant and should be made available to the NICS.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) To the extent they possess relevant records, as set forth in the guidance issued pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, agencies shall prioritize making those records available to the NICS on a regular and ongoing basis.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <i>Measuring Progress</i>. (a) By October 1, 2013, and annually thereafter, agencies that possess relevant records shall submit a report to the President through the Attorney General describing:</p>
<p class="note-body">(i) the relevant records possessed by the agency that can be shared with the NICS consistent with applicable law;</p>
<p class="note-body">(ii) the number of those records submitted to databases accessible by the NICS during each reporting period;</p>
<p class="note-body">(iii) the efforts made to increase the percentage of relevant records possessed by the agency that are submitted to databases accessible by the NICS;</p>
<p class="note-body">(iv) any obstacles to increasing the percentage of records that are submitted to databases accessible by the NICS;</p>
<p class="note-body">(v) for agencies that make qualifying adjudications related to the mental health of a person, the measures put in place to provide notice and programs for relief from disabilities as required under the NIAA;</p>
<p class="note-body">(vi) the measures put in place to correct, modify, or remove records accessible by the NICS when the basis under which the record was made available no longer applies; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(vii) additional steps that will be taken within 1 year of the report to improve the processes by which records are identified, made accessible, and corrected, modified, or removed.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) If an agency certifies in its annual report that it has made available to the NICS its relevant records that can be shared consistent with applicable law, and describes its plan to make new records available to the NICS and to update, modify, or remove existing records electronically no less often than quarterly as required by the NIAA, such agency will not be required to submit further annual reports. Instead, the agency will be required to submit an annual certification to DOJ, attesting that the agency continues to submit relevant records and has corrected, modified, or removed appropriate records.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Short title</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This section may be cited as the &quot;Private Security Officer Employment Authorization Act of 2004&quot;.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) employment of private security officers in the United States is growing rapidly;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) private security officers function as an adjunct to, but not a replacement for, public law enforcement by helping to reduce and prevent crime;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) such private security officers protect individuals, property, and proprietary information, and provide protection to such diverse operations as banks, hospitals, research and development centers, manufacturing facilities, defense and aerospace contractors, high technology businesses, nuclear power plants, chemical companies, oil and gas refineries, airports, communication facilities and operations, office complexes, schools, residential properties, apartment complexes, gated communities, and others;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) sworn law enforcement officers provide significant services to the citizens of the United States in its public areas, and are supplemented by private security officers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the threat of additional terrorist attacks requires cooperation between public and private sectors and demands professional, reliable, and responsible security officers for the protection of people, facilities, and institutions;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the trend in the Nation toward growth in such security services has accelerated rapidly;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) such growth makes available more public sector law enforcement officers to combat serious and violent crimes, including terrorism;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) the American public deserves the employment of qualified, well-trained private security personnel as an adjunct to sworn law enforcement officers; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) private security officers and applicants for private security officer positions should be thoroughly screened and trained.</p>
