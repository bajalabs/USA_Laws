<h3 class="section-head">&sect;30301. Findings</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) 2,100,146 persons were incarcerated in the United States at the end of 2001: 1,324,465 in Federal and State prisons and 631,240 in county and local jails. In 1999, there were more than 10,000,000 separate admissions to and discharges from prisons and jails.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Insufficient research has been conducted and insufficient data reported on the extent of prison rape. However, experts have conservatively estimated that at least 13 percent of the inmates in the United States have been sexually assaulted in prison. Many inmates have suffered repeated assaults. Under this estimate, nearly 200,000 inmates now incarcerated have been or will be the victims of prison rape. The total number of inmates who have been sexually assaulted in the past 20 years likely exceeds 1,000,000.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Inmates with mental illness are at increased risk of sexual victimization. America's jails and prisons house more mentally ill individuals than all of the Nation's psychiatric hospitals combined. As many as 16 percent of inmates in State prisons and jails, and 7 percent of Federal inmates, suffer from mental illness.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Young first-time offenders are at increased risk of sexual victimization. Juveniles are 5 times more likely to be sexually assaulted in adult rather than juvenile facilities&mdash;often within the first 48 hours of incarceration.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Most prison staff are not adequately trained or prepared to prevent, report, or treat inmate sexual assaults.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Prison rape often goes unreported, and inmate victims often receive inadequate treatment for the severe physical and psychological effects of sexual assault&mdash;if they receive treatment at all.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) HIV and AIDS are major public health problems within America's correctional facilities. In 2000, 25,088 inmates in Federal and State prisons were known to be infected with HIV/AIDS. In 2000, HIV/AIDS accounted for more than 6 percent of all deaths in Federal and State prisons. Infection rates for other sexually transmitted diseases, tuberculosis, and hepatitis B and C are also far greater for prisoners than for the American population as a whole. Prison rape undermines the public health by contributing to the spread of these diseases, and often giving a potential death sentence to its victims.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) Prison rape endangers the public safety by making brutalized inmates more likely to commit crimes when they are released&mdash;as 600,000 inmates are each year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) The frequently interracial character of prison sexual assaults significantly exacerbates interracial tensions, both within prison and, upon release of perpetrators and victims from prison, in the community at large.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) Prison rape increases the level of homicides and other violence against inmates and staff, and the risk of insurrections and riots.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) Victims of prison rape suffer severe physical and psychological effects that hinder their ability to integrate into the community and maintain stable employment upon their release from prison. They are thus more likely to become homeless and/or require government assistance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) Members of the public and government officials are largely unaware of the epidemic character of prison rape and the day-to-day horror experienced by victimized inmates.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(13) The high incidence of sexual assault within prisons involves actual and potential violations of the United States Constitution. In Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825 (1994), the Supreme Court ruled that deliberate indiffer<!-- PDFPage:559 -->ence to the substantial risk of sexual assault violates prisoners&apos; rights under the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause of the Eighth Amendment. The Eighth Amendment rights of State and local prisoners are protected through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Pursuant to the power of Congress under Section Five of the Fourteenth Amendment, Congress may take action to enforce those rights in States where officials have demonstrated such indifference. States that do not take basic steps to abate prison rape by adopting standards that do not generate significant additional expenditures demonstrate such indifference. Therefore, such States are not entitled to the same level of Federal benefits as other States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(14) The high incidence of prison rape undermines the effectiveness and efficiency of United States Government expenditures through grant programs such as those dealing with health care; mental health care; disease prevention; crime prevention, investigation, and prosecution; prison construction, maintenance, and operation; race relations; poverty; unemployment and homelessness. The effectiveness and efficiency of these federally funded grant programs are compromised by the failure of State officials to adopt policies and procedures that reduce the incidence of prison rape in that the high incidence of prison rape&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) increases the costs incurred by Federal, State, and local jurisdictions to administer their prison systems;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) increases the levels of violence, directed at inmates and at staff, within prisons;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) increases health care expenditures, both inside and outside of prison systems, and reduces the effectiveness of disease prevention programs by substantially increasing the incidence and spread of HIV, AIDS, tuberculosis, hepatitis B and C, and other diseases;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) increases mental health care expenditures, both inside and outside of prison systems, by substantially increasing the rate of post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, suicide, and the exacerbation of existing mental illnesses among current and former inmates;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) increases the risks of recidivism, civil strife, and violent crime by individuals who have been brutalized by prison rape; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) increases the level of interracial tensions and strife within prisons and, upon release of perpetrators and victims, in the community at large.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(15) The high incidence of prison rape has a significant effect on interstate commerce because it increases substantially&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the costs incurred by Federal, State, and local jurisdictions to administer their prison systems;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the incidence and spread of HIV, AIDS, tuberculosis, hepatitis B and C, and other diseases, contributing to increased health and medical expenditures throughout the Nation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the rate of post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, suicide, and the exacerbation of existing mental illnesses among current and former inmates, contributing to increased health and medical expenditures throughout the Nation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the risk of recidivism, civil strife, and violent crime by individuals who have been brutalized by prison rape.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Implementing the Prison Rape Elimination Act</h4>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum of President of the United States, May 17, 2012, 77 F.R. 30873, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies</p>
<p class="note-body">Sexual violence, against any victim, is an assault on human dignity and an affront to American values. The Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2003 (PREA) was enacted with bipartisan support and established a &quot;zero-tolerance standard&quot; for rape in prisons in the United States. 42 U.S.C. 15602(1) [now 34 U.S.C. 30301(1)].</p>
<p class="note-body">My Administration, with leadership from the Department of Justice, has worked diligently to implement the principles set out in PREA. Today, the Attorney General finalized a rule adopting national standards to prevent, detect, and respond to prison rape. This rule expresses my Administration's conclusion that PREA applies to all Federal confinement facilities, including those operated by executive departments and agencies (agencies) other than the Department of Justice, whether administered by the Federal Government or by a private organization on behalf of the Federal Government.</p>
<p class="note-body">Each agency is responsible for, and must be accountable for, the operations of its own confinement facilities, and each agency has extensive expertise regarding its own facilities, particularly those housing unique populations. Thus, each agency is best positioned to determine how to implement the Federal laws and rules that govern its own operations, the conduct of its own employees, and the safety of persons in its custody. To advance the goals of PREA, we must ensure that all agencies that operate confinement facilities adopt high standards to prevent, detect, and respond to sexual abuse. In addition to adopting such standards, the success of PREA in combating sexual abuse in confinement facilities will depend on effective agency and facility leadership and the development of an agency culture that prioritizes efforts to combat sexual abuse.</p>
<p class="note-body">In order to implement PREA comprehensively across the Federal Government, I hereby direct all agencies with Federal confinement facilities that are not already subject to the Department of Justice's final rule to work with the Attorney General to propose, within 120 days of the date of this memorandum, any rules or procedures necessary to satisfy the requirements of PREA and to finalize any such rules or procedures within 240 days of their proposal.</p>
<p class="note-body">This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with the requirements of Executive Order 13175 of No<!-- PDFPage:560 -->vember 6, 2000 (Consultation and Coordination With Indian Tribal Governments).</p>
<p class="note-body">This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Director of the Office of Management and Budget is hereby authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Annual comprehensive statistical review</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Bureau of Justice Statistics of the Department of Justice (in this section referred to as the &quot;Bureau&quot;) shall carry out, for each calendar year, a comprehensive statistical review and analysis of the incidence and effects of prison rape. The statistical review and analysis shall include, but not be limited to the identification of the common characteristics of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) both victims and perpetrators of prison rape; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) prisons and prison systems with a high incidence of prison rape.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Considerations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In carrying out paragraph (1), the Bureau shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) how rape should be defined for the purposes of the statistical review and analysis;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) how the Bureau should collect information about staff-on-inmate sexual assault;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) how the Bureau should collect information beyond inmate self-reports of prison rape;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) how the Bureau should adjust the data in order to account for differences among prisons as required by subsection (c)(3);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) the categorization of prisons as required by subsection (c)(4); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) whether a preliminary study of prison rape should be conducted to inform the methodology of the comprehensive statistical review.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Solicitation of views</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Bureau of Justice Statistics shall solicit views from representatives of the following: State departments of correction; county and municipal jails; juvenile correctional facilities; former inmates; victim advocates; researchers; and other experts in the area of sexual assault.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Sampling techniques</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The review and analysis under paragraph (1) shall be based on a random sample, or other scientifically appropriate sample, of not less than 10 percent of all Federal, State, and county prisons, and a representative sample of municipal prisons. The selection shall include at least one prison from each State. The selection of facilities for sampling shall be made at the latest practicable date prior to conducting the surveys and shall not be disclosed to any facility or prison system official prior to the time period studied in the survey. Selection of a facility for sampling during any year shall not preclude its selection for sampling in any subsequent year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Surveys</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In carrying out the review and analysis under paragraph (1), the Bureau shall, in addition to such other methods as the Bureau considers appropriate, use surveys and other statistical studies of current and former inmates from a sample of Federal, State, county, and municipal prisons. The Bureau shall ensure the confidentiality of each survey participant, except as authorized in paragraph (7).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Participation in survey</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Federal, State, or local officials or facility administrators that receive a request from the Bureau under subsection (a)(4) or (5) will be required to participate in the national survey and provide access to any inmates under their legal custody.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Reporting on child abuse and neglect</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in section 10134 or 10231 of this title or any other provision of law, including paragraph (5), shall prevent the Bureau (including its agents), in carrying out the review and analysis under paragraph (1), from reporting to the designated public officials such information (and only such information) regarding child abuse or child neglect with respect to which the statutes or regulations of a State (or a political subdivision thereof) require prompt reporting.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:561 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Review Panel on Prison Rape</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Establishment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">To assist the Bureau in carrying out the review and analysis under subsection (a), there is established, within the Department of Justice, the Review Panel on Prison Rape (in this section referred to as the &quot;Panel&quot;).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Membership</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Composition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Panel shall be composed of 3 members, each of whom shall be appointed by the Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Qualifications</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Members of the Panel shall be selected from among individuals with knowledge or expertise in matters to be studied by the Panel.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Public hearings</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The duty of the Panel shall be to carry out, for each calendar year, public hearings concerning the operation of the three prisons with the highest incidence of prison rape and the two prisons with the lowest incidence of prison rape in each category of facilities identified under subsection (c)(4). The Panel shall hold a separate hearing regarding the three Federal or State prisons with the highest incidence of prison rape. The purpose of these hearings shall be to collect evidence to aid in the identification of common characteristics of both victims and perpetrators of prison rape, and the identification of common characteristics of prisons and prison systems with a high incidence of prison rape, and the identification of common characteristics of prisons and prison systems that appear to have been successful in deterring prison rape.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Testimony at hearings</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Public officials</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In carrying out the hearings required under subparagraph (A), the Panel shall request the public testimony of Federal, State, and local officials (and organizations that represent such officials), including the warden or director of each prison, who bears responsibility for the prevention, detection, and punishment of prison rape at each entity, and the head of the prison system encompassing such prison.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Victims</h4>

Such differences may include the mission, security level, size, and jurisdiction under which the prison operates. For each such adjustment made, the Attorney General shall identify and explain such adjustment in the report.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Categorization of prisons</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The report shall divide the prisons surveyed into three categories. One category shall be composed of all Federal and State prisons. The other two categories shall be defined by the Attorney General in order to compare similar institutions.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;30501. Findings</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The incidence of violence motivated by the actual or perceived race, color, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability of the victim poses a serious national problem.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Such violence disrupts the tranquility and safety of communities and is deeply divisive.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) State and local authorities are now and will continue to be responsible for prosecuting the overwhelming majority of violent crimes in the United States, including violent crimes motivated by bias. These authorities can carry out their responsibilities more effectively with greater Federal assistance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Existing Federal law is inadequate to address this problem.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) A prominent characteristic of a violent crime motivated by bias is that it devastates not just the actual victim and the family and friends of the victim, but frequently savages the community sharing the traits that caused the victim to be selected.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Such violence substantially affects interstate commerce in many ways, including the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The movement of members of targeted groups is impeded, and members of such groups are forced to move across State lines to escape the incidence or risk of such violence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Members of targeted groups are prevented from purchasing goods and services, obtaining or sustaining employment, or participating in other commercial activity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Perpetrators cross State lines to commit such violence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) Channels, facilities, and instrumentalities of interstate commerce are used to facilitate the commission of such violence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) Such violence is committed using articles that have traveled in interstate commerce.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) For generations, the institutions of slavery and involuntary servitude were defined by <!-- PDFPage:572 -->the race, color, and ancestry of those held in bondage. Slavery and involuntary servitude were enforced, both prior to and after the adoption of the 13th amendment to the Constitution of the United States, through widespread public and private violence directed at persons because of their race, color, or ancestry, or perceived race, color, or ancestry. Accordingly, eliminating racially motivated violence is an important means of eliminating, to the extent possible, the badges, incidents, and relics of slavery and involuntary servitude.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) Both at the time when the 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments to the Constitution of the United States were adopted, and continuing to date, members of certain religious and national origin groups were and are perceived to be distinct &quot;races&quot;. Thus, in order to eliminate, to the extent possible, the badges, incidents, and relics of slavery, it is necessary to prohibit assaults on the basis of real or perceived religions or national origins, at least to the extent such religions or national origins were regarded as races at the time of the adoption of the 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments to the Constitution of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) Federal jurisdiction over certain violent crimes motivated by bias enables Federal, State, and local authorities to work together as partners in the investigation and prosecution of such crimes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) The problem of crimes motivated by bias is sufficiently serious, widespread, and interstate in nature as to warrant Federal assistance to States, local jurisdictions, and Indian tribes.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Findings</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 117&ndash;13, &sect;2, May 20, 2021, 135 Stat. 265, provided that: &quot;Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(1) Following the spread of COVID&ndash;19 in 2020, there has been a dramatic increase in hate crimes and violence against Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(2) According to a recent report, there were nearly 3,800 reported cases of anti-Asian discrimination and incidents related to COVID&ndash;19 between March 19, 2020, and February 28, 2021, in all 50 States and the District of Columbia.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(3) During this time frame, race has been cited as the primary reason for discrimination, making up over 90 percent of incidents, and the United States condemns and denounces any and all anti-Asian and Pacific Islander sentiment in any form.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(4) Roughly 36 percent of these incidents took place at a business and more than 2,000,000 Asian-American businesses have contributed to the diverse fabric of American life.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(5) More than 1,900,000 Asian-American and Pacific Islander older adults, particularly those older adults who are recent immigrants or have limited English proficiency, may face even greater challenges in dealing with the COVID&ndash;19 pandemic, including discrimination, economic insecurity, and language isolation.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(6) In the midst of this alarming surge in anti-Asian hate crimes and incidents, a shooter murdered the following 8 people in the Atlanta, Georgia region, 7 of whom were women and 6 of whom were women of Asian descent:</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&quot;(A) Xiaojie Tan.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&quot;(B) Daoyou Feng.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&quot;(C) Delaina Ashley Yaun Gonz&#225;lez.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&quot;(D) Paul Andre Michels.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&quot;(E) Soon Chung Park.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&quot;(F) Hyun Jung Grant.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&quot;(G) Suncha Kim.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&quot;(H) Yong Ae Yue.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(7) The people of the United States will always remember the victims of these shootings and stand in solidarity with those affected by this senseless tragedy and incidents of hate that have affected the Asian and Pacific Islander communities.&quot;</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Review of Hate Crimes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 117&ndash;13, &sect;3, May 20, 2021, 135 Stat. 266, provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(a) <cap-smallcap>In General</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than 7 days after the date of enactment of this Act [May 20, 2021], the Attorney General shall designate an officer or employee of the Department of Justice whose responsibility during the applicable period shall be to facilitate the expedited review of hate crimes (as described in section 249 of title 18, United States Code) and reports of any such crime to Federal, State, local, or Tribal law enforcement agencies.</p>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(b) <cap-smallcap>Applicable Period Defined</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this section, the term &apos;applicable period&apos; means the period beginning on the date on which the officer or employee is designated under subsection (a), and ending on the date that is 1 year after the date on which the emergency period described in subparagraph (B) of section 1135(g)(1) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1320b&ndash;5(g)(1)) ends, except that the Attorney General may extend such period as appropriate.&quot;</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(1) establish online reporting of hate crimes or incidents, and to have online reporting that is equally effective for people with disabilities as for people without disabilities available in multiple languages as determined by the Attorney General;</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Condemning and Combating Racism, Xenophobia, and Intolerance Against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in the United States</h4>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum of President of the United States, Jan. 26, 2021, 86 F.R. 7485, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies</p>
<p class="note-body">Advancing inclusion and belonging for people of all races, national origins, and ethnicities is critical to <!-- PDFPage:573 -->guaranteeing the safety and security of the American people. During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID&ndash;19) pandemic, inflammatory and xenophobic rhetoric has put Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) persons, families, communities, and businesses at risk.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Federal Government must recognize that it has played a role in furthering these xenophobic sentiments through the actions of political leaders, including references to the COVID&ndash;19 pandemic by the geographic location of its origin. Such statements have stoked unfounded fears and perpetuated stigma about Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and have contributed to increasing rates of bullying, harassment, and hate crimes against AAPI persons. These actions defied the best practices and guidelines of public health officials and have caused significant harm to AAPI families and communities that must be addressed.</p>
<p class="note-body">Despite these increasing acts of intolerance, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have made our Nation more secure during the COVID&ndash;19 pandemic and throughout our history. An estimated 2 million Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have served on the front lines of this crisis as healthcare providers, as first responders, and in other essential roles. The Federal Government should combat racism, xenophobia, and intolerance against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and should work to ensure that all members of AAPI communities--no matter their background, the language they speak, or their religious beliefs--are treated with dignity and equity.</p>
<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <i>Condemning Racism, Xenophobia, and Intolerance Against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders</i>. The Federal Government has a responsibility to prevent racism, xenophobia, and intolerance against everyone in America, including Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. My Administration condemns and denounces acts of racism, xenophobia, and intolerance against AAPI communities.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec.</cap-smallcap> 2. <i>Combating Racism, Xenophobia, and Intolerance Against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders</i>. (a) The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall, in coordination with the COVID&ndash;19 Health Equity Task Force, consider issuing guidance describing best practices for advancing cultural competency, language access, and sensitivity towards Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in the context of the Federal Government's COVID&ndash;19 response. In developing any such guidance, the Secretary should consider the best practices set forth by public health organizations and experts for mitigating racially discriminatory language in describing the COVID&ndash;19 pandemic.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall take all appropriate steps to ensure that official actions, documents, and statements, including those that pertain to the COVID&ndash;19 pandemic, do not exhibit or contribute to racism, xenophobia, and intolerance against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. Agencies may consult with public health experts, AAPI community leaders, or AAPI community-serving organizations, or may refer to any best practices issued pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, to ensure an understanding of the needs and challenges faced by AAPI communities.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) The Attorney General shall explore opportunities to support, consistent with applicable law, the efforts of State and local agencies, as well as AAPI communities and community-based organizations, to prevent discrimination, bullying, harassment, and hate crimes against AAPI individuals, and to expand collection of data and public reporting regarding hate incidents against such individuals.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec.</cap-smallcap> 3. <i>General Provisions</i>. (a) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:</p>
<p class="note-body">(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or</p>
<p class="note-body">(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Independent agencies are strongly encouraged to comply with the provisions of this memorandum.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) The Secretary of Health and Human Services is authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;30507. Jabara-Heyer NO HATE Act</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Short title</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This section may be cited as the &quot;Khalid Jabara and Heather Heyer National Opposition to Hate, Assault, and Threats to Equality Act of 2021&quot; or the &quot;Jabara-Heyer NO HATE Act&quot;.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The incidence of violence known as hate crimes, or crimes motivated by bias, poses a serious national problem.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) According to data obtained by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the incidence of such violence increased in 2019, the most recent year for which data is available.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) In 1990, Congress enacted the Hate Crime Statistics Act (Public Law 101&ndash;275; 28 U.S.C. 534 note)&#160;<sup><a href="#30507_1_target" name="30507_1">1</a></sup> to provide the Federal Government, law enforcement agencies, and the public with data regarding the incidence of hate crime. The Hate Crime Statistics Act and the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act (division E of Public <!-- PDFPage:576 -->Law 111&ndash;84; 123 Stat. 2835)&#160;<sup><a href="#30507_1_target" name="30507_1">1</a></sup> have enabled Federal authorities to understand and, where appropriate, investigate and prosecute hate crimes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) A more complete understanding of the national problem posed by hate crime is in the public interest and supports the Federal interest in eradicating bias-motivated violence referenced in section 249(b)(1)(C) of title 18.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) However, a complete understanding of the national problem posed by hate crimes is hindered by incomplete data from Federal, State, and local jurisdictions through the Uniform Crime Reports program authorized under section 534 of title 28 and administered by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Multiple factors contribute to the provision of inaccurate and incomplete data regarding the incidence of hate crime through the Uniform Crime Reports program. A significant contributing factor is the quality and quantity of training that State and local law enforcement agencies receive on the identification and reporting of suspected bias-motivated crimes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) The problem of crimes motivated by bias is sufficiently serious, widespread, and interstate in nature as to warrant Federal financial assistance to States and local jurisdictions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) Federal financial assistance with regard to certain violent crimes motivated by bias enables Federal, State, and local authorities to work together as partners in the investigation and prosecution of such crimes.</p>
