<h4 class="note-head">Ex. Ord. No. 14074. Advancing Effective, Accountable Policing and Criminal Justice Practices To Enhance Public Trust and Public Safety</h4>
<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 14074, May 25, 2022, 87 F.R. 32945, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby order as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <i>Policy</i>. Our criminal justice system must respect the dignity and rights of all persons and adhere to our fundamental obligation to ensure fair and impartial justice for all. This is imperative&mdash;not only to live up to our principles as a Nation, but also to build secure, safe, and healthy communities. Protecting public safety requires close partnerships between law enforcement and the communities it serves. Public safety therefore depends on public trust, and public trust in turn requires that our criminal justice system as a whole embodies fair and equal treatment, transparency, and accountability.</p>
<p class="note-body">Law enforcement officers are often a person's first point of contact with our criminal justice system, and we depend on them to uphold these principles while doing the demanding and often life-threatening work of keeping us safe. We expect them to help prevent and solve crimes and frequently call upon them to respond to social problems outside their expertise and beyond their intended role, diverting attention from their critical public safety mission and increasing the risks of an already dangerous job&mdash;which has led to the deaths of law enforcement officers and civilians alike. The vast majority of law enforcement officers do these difficult jobs with honor and integrity, and they work diligently to uphold the law and preserve the public's trust.</p>
<p class="note-body">Yet, there are places in America today, particularly in Black and Brown communities and other communities of color, where the bonds of trust are frayed or broken. We have collectively mourned following law enforcement encounters that have tragically ended in the loss of life. To heal as a Nation, we must acknowledge that those fatal encounters have disparately impacted Black and Brown people and other people of color. The pain of the families of those who have been killed is magnified when expectations for accountability go unmet, and the echoes of their losses reverberate across generations. More broadly, numerous aspects of our criminal justice system are still shaped by race or ethnicity. It is time that we acknowledge the legacy of systemic racism in our criminal justice system and work together to eliminate the racial disparities that endure to this day. Doing so serves all Americans.</p>
<p class="note-body">Through this order, my Administration is taking a critical step in what must be part of a larger effort to strengthen our democracy and advance the principles of equality and dignity. While we can make policing safer and more effective by strengthening trust between law enforcement officers and the communities they serve, we must also reform our broader criminal justice system so that it protects and serves all people equally. To be clear, certain obstacles to lasting reform require legislative solutions. In particular, system-wide change requires funding and support that only the Congress can authorize. But my Administration will use its full authority to take action, including through the implementation of this order, to build and sustain fairness and accountability throughout the criminal justice system.</p>
<p class="note-body">The need for such action could not be more urgent. Since early 2020, communities around the country have faced rising rates of violent crime, requiring law enforcement engagement at a time when law enforcement agencies are already confronting the challenges of staffing shortages and low morale. Strengthening community trust is more critical now than ever, as a community's cooperation with the police to report crimes and assist investigations is essential for deterring violence and holding perpetrators accountable. Reinforcing the partnership between law enforcement and communities is imperative for combating crime and achieving lasting public safety.</p>
<p class="note-body">It is therefore the policy of my Administration to increase public trust and enhance public safety and security by encouraging equitable and community-oriented policing. We must commit to new practices in law enforcement recruitment, hiring, promotion, and retention, as well as training, oversight, and accountability. Insufficient resources, including those dedicated to support officer wellness&mdash;needed more than ever as officers confront rising crime and the effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID&ndash;19) pandemic&mdash;jeopardize the law enforcement community's ability to build and retain a highly qualified and diverse professional workforce. We must work together to ensure that law enforcement agencies have the resources they need as well as the capacity to attract, hire, and retain the best personnel, including resources to institute screening mechanisms to identify unqualified applicants and to support officers in meeting the stresses and challenges of the job. We must also ensure that law enforcement agencies reflect the communities they serve, protect all community members equally, and offer comprehensive training and development opportunities to line officers and supervisors alike.</p>
<p class="note-body">Building trust between law enforcement agencies and the communities they are sworn to protect and serve also requires accountability for misconduct and transparency through data collection and public reporting. It requires proactive measures to prevent profiling based on actual or perceived race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex (including sexual orientation and gender identity), or disability, including by ensuring that new law enforcement technologies do not exacerbate disparities based on these characteristics. It in<!-- PDFPage:14 -->cludes ending discriminatory pretextual stops and offering support for evidence-informed, innovative responses to people with substance use disorders; people with mental health needs; veterans; people with disabilities; vulnerable youth; people who are victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, or trafficking; and people experiencing homelessness or living in poverty. It calls for improving and clarifying standards for police activities such as the execution of search warrants and the use of force.</p>
<p class="note-body">Many law enforcement agencies across the country&mdash;including at the Federal, State, Tribal, local, and territorial level&mdash;have already undertaken important efforts to modernize policing and make our broader criminal justice system more effective and more equitable. Their work has inspired many of the provisions of this order. These agencies&mdash;and the officers who serve within them&mdash;deserve recognition for their leadership and appreciation for setting a standard that others can follow. This order seeks to recognize these key reforms and implement them consistently across Federal law enforcement agencies. Through this order, the Federal Government will also seek to provide State, Tribal, local, and territorial law enforcement agencies with the guidance and support they need to advance their own efforts to strengthen public trust and improve public safety.</p>
<p class="note-body">It is also the policy of my Administration to ensure that conditions of confinement are safe and humane, and that those who are incarcerated are not subjected to unnecessary or excessive uses of force, are free from prolonged segregation, and have access to quality health care, including substance use disorder care and mental health care. We must provide people who are incarcerated with meaningful opportunities for rehabilitation and the tools and support they need to transition successfully back to society. Individuals who have been involved in the criminal justice system face many barriers in transitioning back into society, including limited access to housing, public benefits, health care, trauma-informed services and support, education, nutrition, employment and occupational licensing, credit, the ballot, and other critical opportunities. Lowering barriers to reentry is essential to reducing recidivism and reducing crime.</p>
<p class="note-body">Finally, no one should be required to serve an excessive prison sentence. When the Congress passed the First Step Act of 2018 (Public Law 115&ndash;391), it sought to relieve people from unfair and unduly harsh sentences, including those driven by harsh mandatory minimums and the unjust sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine offenses. My Administration will fully implement the First Step Act, including by supporting sentencing reductions in appropriate cases and by allowing eligible incarcerated people to participate in recidivism reduction programming and earn time credits.</p>
<p class="note-body">With these measures, together we can strengthen public safety and the bonds of trust between law enforcement and the community and build a criminal justice system that respects the dignity and equality of all in America.</p>

The interagency working group shall, to the extent possible, coordinate on the development of a set of core policies and best practices to be used across all Federal LEAs regarding recruitment, hiring, promotion, and retention, while also identifying any agency-specific unique recruitment, hiring, promotion, and retention challenges. As part of this process, the interagency working group shall:</p>
<p class="note-body">(i) assess existing policies and identify and share best practices for recruitment and hiring, including by con<!-- PDFPage:15 -->sidering the merits and feasibility of recruiting law enforcement officers who are representative of the communities they are sworn to serve (including recruits who live in or are from these communities) and by considering the recommendations made in the Federal LEAs&apos; strategic plans required under Executive Order 14035 of June 25, 2021 (Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility in the Federal Workforce) [42 U.S.C. 2000e note];</p>
<p class="note-body">(ii) assess existing policies and identify and share best practices for promotion and retention, including by identifying ways to expand mentorship and leadership development opportunities for law enforcement officers;</p>
<p class="note-body">(iii) develop best practices for ensuring that performance evaluations and promotion decisions for Federal law enforcement officers include an assessment of the officer's adherence to agency policies, and that performance evaluations and promotion decisions for supervisors include an assessment of the supervisor's effectiveness in addressing misconduct by officers they supervise; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(iv) develop best practices for conducting background investigations and implementing properly validated selection procedures, including vetting mechanisms and ongoing employment screening, that, consistent with the First Amendment and all applicable laws, help avoid the hiring and retention of law enforcement officers who promote unlawful violence, white supremacy, or other bias against persons based on race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex (including sexual orientation and gender identity), or disability.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Within 180 days of the publication of the interagency working group's action plan described in subsection (a) of this section, the heads of Federal LEAs shall update and implement their policies and protocols for recruiting, hiring, promotion, and retention, consistent with the core policies and best practices identified and developed pursuant to subsection (a) of this section.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">From amounts made available under section 10103(c) of this title, the Director of the Office of Weed and Seed Strategies may implement strategies, to be known as Weed and Seed strategies, to prevent, control, and reduce violent crime, criminal drug-related activity, and gang activity in designated Weed-and-Seed communities. Each such strategy shall involve both of the following activities:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Weeding</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Activities, to be known as Weeding activities, which shall include promoting and coordinating a broad spectrum of community efforts (especially those of law enforcement agencies and prosecutors) to arrest, and to sanction or incarcerate, persons in that community who participate or engage in violent crime, criminal drug-related activity, and other crimes that threaten the quality of life in that community.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Seeding</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Activities, to be known as Seeding activities, which shall include promoting and coordinating a broad spectrum of community efforts (such as drug abuse education, mentoring, and employment counseling) to provide&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) human services, relating to prevention, intervention, or treatment, for at-risk individuals and families; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) community revitalization efforts, including enforcement of building codes and development of the economy.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Guidelines</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Director shall issue guidelines for the development and implementation of Weed and Seed strategies under this section. The guidelines shall ensure that the Weed and Seed strategy for a community referred to in subsection (a) shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) be planned and implemented through and under the auspices of a steering committee, properly established in the community, comprised of&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:30 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in a voting capacity, representatives of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) appropriate law enforcement agencies; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) other public and private agencies, and neighborhood and community-based organizations, interested in criminal justice and community-based development and revitalization in the community; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the United States Attorney for the District encompassing the community;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) describe how law enforcement agencies, other public and private agencies, neighborhood and community-based organizations, and interested citizens are to cooperate in implementing the strategy; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) incorporate a community-policing component that shall serve as a bridge between the Weeding activities under subsection (a)(1) and the Seeding activities under subsection (a)(2).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Designation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For a community to be designated as a Weed-and-Seed community for purposes of subsection (a)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the United States Attorney for the District encompassing the community must certify to the Director that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the community suffers from consistently high levels of crime or otherwise is appropriate for such designation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the Weed and Seed strategy proposed, adopted, or implemented by the steering committee has a high probability of improving the criminal justice system within the community and contains all the elements required by the Director; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the steering committee is capable of implementing the strategy appropriately; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the community must agree to formulate a timely and effective plan to independently sustain the strategy (or, at a minimum, a majority of the best practices of the strategy) when assistance under this section is no longer available.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Application</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An application for designation as a Weed-and-Seed community for purposes of subsection (a) shall be submitted to the Director by the steering committee of the community in such form, and containing such information and assurances, as the Director may require. The application shall propose&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a sustainable Weed and Seed strategy that includes&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the active involvement of the United States Attorney for the District encompassing the community, the Drug Enforcement Administration's special agent in charge for the jurisdiction encompassing the community, and other Federal law enforcement agencies operating in the vicinity;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a significant community-oriented policing component; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) demonstrated coordination with complementary neighborhood and community-based programs and initiatives; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a methodology with outcome measures and specific objective indicia of performance to be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the strategy.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Grants</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In implementing a strategy for a community under subsection (a), the Director may make grants to that community.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Uses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For each grant under this subsection, the community receiving that grant may not use any of the grant amounts for construction, except that the Assistant Attorney General may authorize use of grant amounts for incidental or minor construction, renovation, or remodeling.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A community may not receive grants under this subsection (or fall within such a community)&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) for more than 5 separate fiscal years, except that the Assistant Attorney General may, in single increments and only upon a showing of extraordinary circumstances, authorize grants for not more than 3 additional separate fiscal years; or</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Distribution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In making grants under this subsection, the Director shall ensure that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to the extent practicable, the distribution of such grants is geographically equitable and includes both urban and rural areas of varying population and area; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) priority is given to communities that clearly and effectively coordinate crime prevention programs with other Federal programs in a manner that addresses the overall needs of such communities.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Federal share</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Subject to subparagraph (B), the Federal share of a grant under this subsection may not exceed 75 percent of the total costs of the projects described in the application for which the grant was made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The requirement of subparagraph (A)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) may be satisfied in cash or in kind; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) may be waived by the Assistant Attorney General upon a determination that the financial circumstances affecting the applicant warrant a finding that such a waiver is equitable.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Supplement, not supplant</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">To receive a grant under this subsection, the applicant must provide assurances that the amounts received under the grant shall be <!-- PDFPage:31 -->used to supplement, not supplant, non-Federal funds that would otherwise be available for programs or services provided in the community.</p>

In carrying out the functions of the Office, the Director shall be subject to the authority, direction, and control of the Attorney General. Such authority, direction, and control may be delegated only to the Assistant Attorney General, without redelegation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The purpose of the Office shall be to carry out and coordinate program assessments of, take actions to ensure compliance with the terms of, and manage information with respect to, grants under programs covered by subsection (b). The Director shall take special conditions of the grant into account and consult with the office that issued those conditions to ensure appropriate compliance.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Exclusivity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Office shall be the exclusive element of the Department of Justice, other than the Inspector General, performing functions and activities for the purpose specified in paragraph (2). There are hereby transferred to the Office all functions and activities, other than functions and activities of the Inspector General, for such purpose performed immediately before January 5, 2006, by any other element of the Department.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Covered programs</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Any grant program carried out by the Office of Justice Programs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Any other grant program carried out by the Department of Justice that the Attorney General considers appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Program assessments required</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Director shall select grants awarded under the programs covered by subsection (b) and carry out program assessments on such grants. In selecting such grants, the Director shall ensure that the aggregate amount awarded under the grants so selected represent not less than 10 percent of the aggregate amount of money awarded under all such grant programs.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Relationship to NIJ evaluations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">This subsection does not affect the authority or duty of the Director of the National Institute of Justice to carry out overall evaluations of programs covered by subsection (b), except that such Director shall consult with the Director of the Office in carrying out such evaluations.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) at the end of each year of the grant period, if the grant period is more than 1 year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Compliance actions required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Director shall take such actions to ensure compliance with the terms of a grant as the Director considers appropriate with respect to each grant that the Director determines (in consultation with the head of the element of the Department of Justice concerned), through a program assessment under subsection (a) or other means, is not in compliance with such terms. In the case of a misuse of more than 1 percent of the grant amount concerned, the Director shall, in addition to any other action to ensure compliance that the Director considers appropriate, ensure that the entity responsible for such misuse ceases to receive any funds under any program covered by subsection (b) until such entity repays to the Attorney General an amount equal to the amounts misused. The Director may, in unusual circumstances, grant relief from this requirement to ensure that an innocent party is not punished.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Grant management system</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Director shall establish and maintain, in consultation with the chief information officer of the Office, a modern, automated system for managing all information relating to the grants made under the programs covered by subsection (b).</p>

<h4 class="note-sub-head">&quot;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&quot;This Act may be cited as the &apos;Crime Victims With Disabilities Awareness Act&apos;.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&quot;SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSES.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(1) although research conducted abroad demonstrates that individuals with developmental disabilities are at a 4 to 10 times higher risk of becoming crime victims than those without disabilities, there have been no significant studies on this subject conducted in the United States;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(2) in fact, the National Crime Victim's Survey, conducted annually by the Bureau of Justice Statistics of the Department of Justice, does not specifically collect data relating to crimes against individuals with developmental disabilities;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(3) studies in Canada, Australia, and Great Britain consistently show that victims with developmental disabilities suffer repeated victimization because so few of the crimes against them are reported, and even when they are, there is sometimes a reluctance by police, prosecutors, and judges to rely on the testimony of a disabled individual, making individuals with developmental disabilities a target for criminal predators;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(4) research in the United States needs to be done to&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&quot;(A) understand the nature and extent of crimes against individuals with developmental disabilities;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&quot;(B) describe the manner in which the justice system responds to crimes against individuals with developmental disabilities; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&quot;(C) identify programs, policies, or laws that hold promises for making the justice system more responsive to crimes against individuals with developmental disabilities; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(5) the National Academy of Science Committee on Law and Justice of the National Research Council is a premier research institution with unique experience in developing seminal, multidisciplinary studies to establish a strong research base from which to make public policy.</p>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(b) <cap-smallcap>Purposes</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The purposes of this Act are&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(1) to increase public awareness of the plight of victims of crime who are individuals with developmental disabilities;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(2) to collect data to measure the extent of the problem of crimes against individuals with developmental disabilities; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(3) to develop a basis to find new strategies to address the safety and justice needs of victims of crime who are individuals with developmental disabilities.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&quot;SEC. 3. DEFINITION OF DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&quot;In this Act, the term &apos;developmental disability&apos; has the meaning given the term in section 102 of the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act of 2000 [42 U.S.C. 15002].</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&quot;SEC. 4. STUDY.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(a) <cap-smallcap>In General</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Attorney General shall conduct a study to increase knowledge and information about crimes against individuals with developmental disabilities that will be useful in developing new strategies to reduce the incidence of crimes against those individuals.</p>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(b) <cap-smallcap>Issues Addressed</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The study conducted under this section shall address such issues as&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(1) the nature and extent of crimes against individuals with developmental disabilities;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(2) the risk factors associated with victimization of individuals with developmental disabilities;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(3) the manner in which the justice system responds to crimes against individuals with developmental disabilities; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(4) the means by which States may establish and maintain a centralized computer database on the incidence of crimes against individuals with disabilities within a State.</p>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(c) <cap-smallcap>National Academy of Sciences</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In carrying out this section, the Attorney General shall consider contracting with the Committee on Law and Justice of the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences to provide research for the study conducted under this section.</p>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(d) <cap-smallcap>Report</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than 18 months after the date of enactment of this Act [Oct. 27, 1998], the Attorney General shall submit to the Committees on the Judiciary of the Senate and the House of Representatives a report describing the results of the study conducted under this section.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&quot;SEC. 5. NATIONAL CRIME VICTIM'S SURVEY.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&quot;Not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of this Act, as part of each National Crime Victim's Survey, the Attorney General shall include statistics relating to&mdash;</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Grants authorized</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">From amounts made available to carry out this part, the Attorney General may, in accordance with the formula established under section 10156 of this title, make grants to States and units of local government, for use by the State or unit of local government to provide additional personnel, equipment, supplies, contractual support, training, technical assistance, and information systems for criminal justice or civil proceedings, including for any one or more of the following programs:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Law enforcement programs.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Any security enhancements or any equipment to any nongovernmental entity that is not engaged in criminal justice or public safety.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Unless the Attorney General certifies that extraordinary and exigent circumstances exist that make the use of such funds to provide such matters essential to the maintenance of public safety and good order&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) luxury items;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Subparagraph (d)(1) shall not be construed to prohibit the use, directly or indirectly, of funds provided under this part to provide security at a public event, such as a political convention or major sports event, so long as such security is provided under applicable laws and procedures.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Annual report on crisis intervention programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Attorney General shall publish an annual report with respect to grants awarded for crisis intervention programs or initiatives under subsection (a)(1)(I) that contains&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the average annual number of such crimes reported by all States for such years.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Minimum allocation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If carrying out paragraph (1) would result in any State receiving an allocation less than 0.25 percent of the total amount (in this paragraph referred to as a &quot;minimum allocation State&quot;), then paragraph (1), as so carried out, shall not apply, and the Attorney General shall instead&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) allocate 0.25 percent of the total amount to each State; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) using the amount remaining after carrying out subparagraph (A), carry out paragraph (1) in a manner that excludes each minimum allocation State, including the population of and the crimes reported by such State.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the total expenditure on criminal justice by the State government and units of local government within the State in such year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Remaining amounts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in subsection (e)(1), any amounts remaining after the allocation required by paragraph (1) shall be made available to units of local government by the State for the purposes described in section 10152 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Allocations to local governments</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Allocation</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">From the amounts referred to in paragraph (1) with respect to a State (in this subsection referred to as the &quot;local amount&quot;), the Attorney General shall allocate to each <!-- PDFPage:51 -->unit of local government an amount which bears the same ratio to such share as the average annual number of part 1 violent crimes reported by such unit to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for the 3 most recent calendar years for which such data is available bears to the number of part 1 violent crimes reported by all units of local government in the State in which the unit is located to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for such years.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Transitional rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), for fiscal years 2006, 2007, and 2008, the Attorney General shall allocate the local amount to units of local government in the same manner that, under the Local Government Law Enforcement Block Grants program in effect immediately before January 5, 2006, the reserved amount was allocated among reporting and nonreporting units of local government.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Annexed units</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a unit of local government in the State has been annexed since the date of the collection of the data used by the Attorney General in making allocations pursuant to this section, the Attorney General shall pay the amount that would have been allocated to such unit of local government to the unit of local government that annexed it.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Resolution of disparate allocations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the Attorney General certifies that a unit of local government bears more than 50 percent of the costs of prosecution or incarceration that arise with respect to part 1 violent crimes reported by a specified geographically constituent unit of local government; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) but for this paragraph, the amount of funds allocated under this section to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) any one such specified geographically constituent unit of local government exceeds 150 percent of the amount allocated to the unit of local government certified pursuant to clause (i); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) more than one such specified geographically constituent unit of local government exceeds 400 percent of the amount allocated to the unit of local government certified pursuant to clause (i),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">then in order to qualify for payment under this subsection, the unit of local government certified pursuant to clause (i), together with any such specified geographically constituent units of local government described in clause (ii), shall submit to the Attorney General a joint application for the aggregate of funds allocated to such units of local government. Such application shall specify the amount of such funds that are to be distributed to each of the units of local government and the purposes for which such funds are to be used. The units of local government involved may establish a joint local advisory board for the purposes of carrying out this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) In this paragraph, the term &quot;geographically constituent unit of local government&quot; means a unit of local government that has jurisdiction over areas located within the boundaries of an area over which a unit of local government certified pursuant to clause (i) has jurisdiction.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Limitation on allocations to units of local government</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Maximum allocation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No unit of local government shall receive a total allocation under this section that exceeds such unit's total expenditures on criminal justice services for the most recently completed fiscal year for which data are available. Any amount in excess of such total expenditures shall be allocated proportionally among units of local government whose allocations under this section do not exceed their total expenditures on such services.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Allocations under $10,000</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the allocation under this section to a unit of local government is less than $10,000 for any fiscal year, the direct grant to the State under subsection (c) shall be increased by the amount of such allocation, to be distributed (for the purposes described in section 10152 of this title) among State police departments that provide criminal justice services to units of local government and units of local government whose allocation under this section is less than $10,000.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Non-reporting units</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No allocation under this section shall be made to a unit of local government that has not reported at least three years of data on part 1 violent crimes of the Uniform Crime Reports to the Federal Bureau of Investigation within the immediately preceding 10 years.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Funds not used by the State</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Attorney General determines, on the basis of information available during any grant period, that any allocation (or portion thereof) under this section to a State for such grant period will not be required, or that a State will be unable to qualify or receive funds under this part, or that a State chooses not to participate in the program established under this part, then such State's allocation (or portion thereof) shall be awarded by the Attorney General to units of local government, or combinations thereof, within such State, giving priority to those jurisdictions with the highest annual number of part 1 violent crimes of the Uniform Crime Reports reported by the unit of local government to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for the three most recent calendar years for which such data are available.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Special rules for Puerto Rico</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) All funds set aside for Commonwealth government</h4>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this chapter or any other Act shall be construed to authorize any department, agency, officer, or employee of the United States to exercise any direction, supervision, or control over any police force or any other criminal justice agency of any State or any political subdivision thereof.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Racial imbalance requirement restriction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed to authorize the National Institute of Justice, the Bureau of Justice Statistics, or the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to require, or condition the availability or amount of a grant upon the adoption by an applicant or grantee under this chapter of a percentage ratio, quota system, or other program to achieve racial balance in any criminal justice agency; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to deny or discontinue a grant because of the refusal of an applicant or grantee under this chapter to adopt such a ratio, system, or other program.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Discrimination prohibited; notice of non-compliance; suspension and restoration of payments; hearing; civil action by Attorney General; private action, attorney fees, intervention by Attorney General</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) No person in any State shall on the ground of race, color, religion, national origin, or sex be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under or denied employment in connection with any programs or activity funded in whole or in part with funds made available under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Whenever there has been&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) receipt of notice of a finding, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, by a Federal court (other than in an action brought by the <!-- PDFPage:69 -->Attorney General) or State court, or by a Federal or State administrative agency, to the effect that there has been a pattern or practice of discrimination in violation of paragraph (1); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) a determination after an investigation by the Office of Justice Programs (prior to a hearing under subparagraph (F) but including an opportunity for the State government or unit of local government to make a documentary submission regarding the allegation of discrimination with respect to such program or activity, with funds made available under this chapter) that a State government or unit of local government is not in compliance with paragraph (1);</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the Office of Justice Programs shall, within ten days after such occurrence, notify the chief executive of the affected State, or the State in which the affected unit of local government is located, and the chief executive of such unit of local government, that such program or activity has been so found or determined not to be in compliance with paragraph (1), and shall request each chief executive, notified under this subparagraph with respect to such violation, to secure compliance. For purposes of clause (i) a finding by a Federal or State administrative agency shall be deemed rendered after notice and opportunity for a hearing if it is rendered pursuant to procedures consistent with the provisions of subchapter II of chapter 5 of title 5.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In the event the chief executive secures compliance after notice pursuant to subparagraph (A), the terms and conditions with which the affected State government or unit of local government agrees to comply shall be set forth in writing and signed by the chief executive of the State, by the chief executive of such unit (in the event of a violation by a unit of local government), and by the Office of Justice Programs. On or prior to the effective date of the agreement, the Office of Justice Programs shall send a copy of the agreement to each complainant, if any, with respect to such violation. The chief executive of the State, or the chief executive of the unit (in the event of a violation by a unit of local government) shall file semiannual reports with the Office of Justice Programs detailing the steps taken to comply with the agreement. These reports shall cease to be filed upon the determination of the Office of Justice Programs that compliance has been secured, or upon the determination by a Federal or State court that such State government or local governmental unit is in compliance with this section. Within fifteen days of receipt of such reports, the Office of Justice Programs shall send a copy thereof to each such complainant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) If, at the conclusion of ninety days after notification under subparagraph (A)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) compliance has not been secured by the chief executive of that State or the chief executive of that unit of local government; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) an administrative law judge has not made a determination under subparagraph (F) that it is likely the State government or unit of local government will prevail on the merits; the Office of Justice Programs shall notify the Attorney General that compliance has not been secured and caused to have suspended further payment of any funds under this chapter to that program or activity. Such suspension shall be limited to the specific program or activity cited by the Office of Justice Programs in the notice under subparagraph (A). Such suspension shall be effective for a period of not more than one hundred and twenty days, or, if there is a hearing under subparagraph (G), not more than thirty days after the conclusion of such hearing, unless there has been an express finding by the Office of Justice Programs, after notice and opportunity for such a hearing, that the recipient is not in compliance with paragraph (1).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(D) Payment of the suspended funds shall resume only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) such State government or unit of local government enters into a compliance agreement approved by the Office of Justice Programs and the Attorney General in accordance with subparagraph (B);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) such State government or unit of local government complies fully with the final order or judgment of a Federal or State court, or by a Federal or State administrative agency if that order or judgment covers all the matters raised by the Office of Justice Programs in the notice pursuant to subparagraph (A), or is found to be in compliance with paragraph (1) by such court; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) after a hearing the Office of Justice Programs pursuant to subparagraph (F) finds that noncompliance has not been demonstrated.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(E) Whenever the Attorney General files a civil action alleging a pattern or practice of discriminatory conduct on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, or sex in any program or activity of a State government or unit of local government which State government or unit of local government receives funds made available under this chapter, and the conduct allegedly violates the provisions of this section and neither party within forty-five days after such filing has been granted such preliminary relief with regard to the suspension or payment of funds as may be otherwise available by law, the Office of Justice Programs shall cause to have suspended further payment of any funds under this chapter to that specific program or activity alleged by the Attorney General to be in violation of the provisions of this subsection until such time as the court orders resumption of payment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(F) Prior to the suspension of funds under subparagraph (C), but within the ninety-day period after notification under subparagraph (C), the State government or unit of local government may request an expedited preliminary hearing on the record in accordance with section 554 of title 5, in order to determine whether it is likely that the State government or unit of local government would, at a full hearing under subparagraph (G), prevail on the merits on the issue of the alleged noncompliance. A finding under this subparagraph by the administrative law judge in favor of the State government or unit of local government shall defer the suspension of funds under subparagraph (C) pending a finding of noncompliance at the conclusion of the hearing on the merits under subparagraph (G).</p>
<!-- PDFPage:70 --><p class="statutory-body">(G)(i) At any time after notification under subparagraph (A), but before the conclusion of the one-hundred-and-twenty-day period referred to in subparagraph (C), a State government or unit of local government may request a hearing on the record in accordance with section 554 of title 5, which the Office of Justice Programs shall initiate within sixty days of such request.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) Within thirty days after the conclusion of the hearing, or, in the absence of a hearing, at the conclusion of the one-hundred-and-twenty-day period referred to in subparagraph (C), the Office of Justice Programs shall make a finding of compliance or noncompliance. If the Office of Justice Programs makes a finding of noncompliance, the Office of Justice Programs shall notify the Attorney General in order that the Attorney General may institute a civil action under paragraph (3), cause to have terminated the payment of funds under this chapter, and, if appropriate, seek repayment of such funds.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) If the Office of Justice Programs makes a finding of compliance, payment of the suspended funds shall resume as provided in subparagraph (D).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(H) Any State government or unit of local government aggrieved by a final determination of the Office of Justice Programs under subparagraph (G) may appeal such determination as provided in section 804&#160;<sup><a href="#10228_1_target" name="10228_1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Whenever the Attorney General has reason to believe that a State government or unit of local government has engaged in or is engaging in a pattern or practice in violation of the provisions of this section, the Attorney General may bring a civil action in an appropriate United States district court. Such court may grant as relief any temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction, or other order, as necessary or appropriate to insure the full enjoyment of the rights described in this section, including the suspension, termination, or repayment of such funds made available under this chapter as the court may deem appropriate, or placing any further such funds in escrow pending the outcome of the litigation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) Whenever a State government or unit of local government, or any officer or employee thereof acting in an official capacity, has engaged or is engaging in any act or practice prohibited by this subsection, a civil action may be instituted after exhaustion of administrative remedies by the person aggrieved in an appropriate United States district court or in a State court of general jurisdiction. Administrative remedies shall be deemed to be exhausted upon the expiration of sixty days after the date the administrative complaint was filed with the Office of Justice Programs or any other administrative enforcement agency, unless within such period there has been a determination by the Office of Justice Programs or the agency on the merits of the complaint, in which case such remedies shall be deemed exhausted at the time the determination becomes final.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In any civil action brought by a private person to enforce compliance with any provision of this subsection, the court may grant to a prevailing plaintiff reasonable attorney fees, unless the court determines that the lawsuit is frivolous, vexatious, brought for harassment purposes, or brought principally for the purpose of gaining attorney fees.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) In any action instituted under this section to enforce compliance with paragraph (1), the Attorney General, or a specially designated assistant for or in the name of the United States, may intervene upon timely application if he certifies that the action is of general public importance. In such action the United States shall be entitled to the same relief as if it had instituted the action.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The amount payable under subsections (a) and (b), with respect to the death or permanent and total disability of a public safety officer, shall be the greater of&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Limitations on benefits</h4>

<h4 class="note-head">Findings</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 117&ndash;172, &sect;2, Aug. 16, 2022, 136 Stat. 2098, provided that: &quot;Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(1) Every day, public safety officers, including police officers, firefighters, emergency medical technicians, and others, work to maintain the safety, health, and well-being of the communities they serve.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(2) This means public safety officers are routinely called to respond to stressful and potentially traumatic situations, often putting their own lives in danger.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(3) This work not only puts public safety officers at-risk for experiencing harm, serious injury, and cumulative and acute trauma, but also places them at up to 25.6 times higher risk for developing post-traumatic stress disorder when compared to individuals without such experiences.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(4) Psychological evidence indicates that law enforcement officers experience significant job-related stressors and exposures that may confer increased risk for mental health morbidities (such as post-traumatic stress disorder and suicidal thoughts, ideation, intents, and behaviors) and hastened mortality.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(5) Public safety officers often do not have the resources or support they need, leaving them at higher risk for long-term mental health consequences.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(6) Whereas, although the Department of Defense already considers servicemember suicides to be line-of-duty deaths and provides Federal support to eligible surviving families, the Federal Government does not recognize public safety officer suicides as deaths in the line of duty.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(7) In 2017, the Department of Justice approved 481 claims under the Public Safety Officers&apos; Benefits Program under subpart 1 of part L of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (34 U.S.C. 10281 et seq.), but not one of them for the more than 240 public safety officers who died by suicide that year.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(8) Public safety officers who have died or are disabled as a result of suicide or post-traumatic stress disorder do not qualify for the Public Safety Officers&apos; Benefits Program, despite the fact that public safety officers are more likely to die by suicide than from any other line-of-duty cause of death.&quot;</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(1) an infectious disease pandemic known as COVID&ndash;19 exists;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(2) to date, there is much still unknown about COVID&ndash;19, but it is known that COVID&ndash;19 and related complications may be fatal;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(3) services provided by public safety officers are nonetheless essential during this pandemic;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(4) due to the COVID&ndash;19 pandemic and what is currently known about how the disease is spread, public safety officers are uncharacteristically at risk of contracting the disease; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(5) although the Public Safety Officers&apos; Benefits program currently covers deaths and permanent and total disabilities resulting from infectious disease sustained by public safety officers in carrying out their duties, the determination of claims involving personal injuries believed to have resulted from COVID&ndash;19 or its complications may be uniquely challenging or delayed given the lack of&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&quot;(A) definitive testing and medical records at this time; and</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Findings</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 117&ndash;103, div. W, title XV, &sect;1502, Mar. 15, 2022, 136 Stat. 951, provided that: &quot;Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(1) Approximately 1 in 15 children is exposed to domestic violence each year.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(2) Most child abuse is perpetrated in the family and by a parent. Intimate partner violence and child abuse overlap in the same families at rates between 30 and 60 percent. A child's risk of abuse increases after a perpetrator of intimate partner violence separates from a domestic partner, even when the perpetrator has not previously directly abused the child. Children who have witnessed intimate partner violence are approximately 4 times more likely to experience direct child maltreatment than children who have not witnessed intimate partner violence.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(3) More than 75 percent of child sexual abuse is perpetrated by a family member or a person known to the child. Data of the Department of Justice shows that family members are 49 percent, or almost half, of the perpetrators of crimes against child sex assault victims younger than 6 years of age.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(4) Research suggests a child's exposure to a batterer is among the strongest indicators of risk of incest victimization. One study found that female children with fathers who are batterers of their mothers were 6.5 times more likely to experience father-daughter incest than female children who do not have abusive fathers.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(5) Child abuse is a major public health issue in the United States. Total lifetime financial costs associated with just 1 year of confirmed cases of child maltreatment, including child physical abuse, sexual abuse, psychological abuse, and neglect, result in $124,000,000,000 in annual costs to the economy of the United States, or approximately 1 percent of the gross domestic product of the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(6) Empirical research indicates that courts regularly discount allegations of child physical and sexual abuse when those allegations are raised in child custody cases. Courts believed less than &#188; of claims that a father has committed child physical or sexual abuse. With respect to cases in which an allegedly abusive parent claimed the mother &quot;alienated&quot; the child, courts believed only 1 out of 51 claims of sexual molestation by a father. Independent research indicates that child sexual abuse allegations are credible between 50 and 70 percent of the time.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(7) Empirical research shows that alleged or known abusive parents are often granted custody or unprotected parenting time by courts. Approximately 1/3 of parents alleged to have committed child abuse took primary custody from the protective parent reporting the abuse, placing children at ongoing risk.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(8) Researchers have documented nearly 800 child murders in the United States since 2008 committed by a divorcing or separating parent. More than 100 of these child murders are known to have occurred after a court ordered the child to have contact with the dangerous parent over the objection of a safe parent or caregiver.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(9) Scientifically unsound theories that treat abuse allegations of mothers as likely false attempts to undermine fathers are frequently applied in family court to minimize or deny reports of abuse of parents and children. Many experts who testify against abuse allegations lack expertise in the relevant type of alleged abuse, relying instead on unsound and unproven theories.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(10) Judges presiding over custody cases involving allegations of child abuse, child sexual abuse, and domestic violence are rarely required to receive training on these subjects, and most States have not established standards for such training.&quot;</p>
<p class="note-body">[For definitions of terms used in section 1502 of div. W of Pub. L. 117&ndash;103, set out above, see section 12291 of this title, as made applicable by section 2(b) of div. W of Pub. L. 117&ndash;103, which is set out as a note under section 12291 of this title.]</p>

<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 117&ndash;103, div. W, title XV, &sect;1503, Mar. 15, 2022, 136 Stat. 952, provided that: &quot;The purposes of this title [see Short Title of 2022 Amendment note set out under section 10101 of this title] are to&mdash;</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(2) strengthen the abilities of courts to&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&quot;(A) recognize and adjudicate domestic violence and child abuse allegations based on valid, admissible evidence; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&quot;(B) enter orders that protect and minimize the risk of harm to children; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(3) ensure that professional personnel involved in cases containing domestic violence or child abuse allegations receive trauma-informed and culturally appropriate training on the dynamics, signs, and impact of domestic violence and child abuse, including child sexual abuse.&quot;</p>
<p class="note-body">[For definitions of terms used in section 1503 of div. W of Pub. L. 117&ndash;103, set out above, see section 12291 of this title, as made applicable by section 2(b) of div. W of Pub. L. 117&ndash;103, which is set out as a note under section 12291 of this title.]</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;10534. James Guelff and Chris McCurley Body Armor Act of 2002</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Short title</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This section may be cited as the &quot;James Guelff and Chris McCurley Body Armor Act of 2002&quot;.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) nationally, police officers and ordinary citizens are facing increased danger as criminals use more deadly weaponry, body armor, and other sophisticated assault gear;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) crime at the local level is exacerbated by the interstate movement of body armor and other assault gear;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) there is a traffic in body armor moving in or otherwise affecting interstate commerce, and existing Federal controls over such traffic do not adequately enable the States to control this traffic within their own borders through the exercise of their police power;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) recent incidents, such as the murder of San Francisco Police Officer James Guelff by an assailant wearing 2 layers of body armor, a 1997 bank shoot out in north Hollywood, California, between police and 2 heavily armed suspects outfitted in body armor, and the 1997 murder of Captain Chris McCurley of the Etowah County, Alabama Drug Task Force by a drug dealer shielded by protective body armor, demonstrate the serious threat to community safety posed by criminals who wear body armor during the commission of a violent crime;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) of the approximately 1,500 officers killed in the line of duty since 1980, more than 30 percent could have been saved by body armor, and the risk of dying from gunfire is 14 times higher for an officer without a bulletproof vest;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the Department of Justice has estimated that 25 percent of State and local police are not issued body armor;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) the Federal Government is well-equipped to grant local police departments access to body armor that is no longer needed by Federal agencies; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) Congress has the power, under the interstate commerce clause and other provisions of the Constitution of the United States, to enact legislation to regulate interstate commerce that affects the integrity and safety of our communities.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In this section:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Body armor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &quot;body armor&quot; means any product sold or offered for sale, in interstate or foreign commerce, as personal protective body covering intended to protect against gunfire, regardless of whether the product is to be worn alone or is sold as a complement to another product or garment.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Law enforcement agency</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &quot;law enforcement agency&quot; means an agency of the United States, a State, or a political subdivision of a State, authorized by law or by a government agency to engage in or <!-- PDFPage:168 -->supervise the prevention, detection, investigation, or prosecution of any violation of criminal law.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Law enforcement officer</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &quot;law enforcement officer&quot; means any officer, agent, or employee of the United States, a State, or a political subdivision of a State, authorized by law or by a government agency to engage in or supervise the prevention, detection, investigation, or prosecution of any violation of criminal law.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Amendment of sentencing guidelines with respect to body armor</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Pursuant to its authority under section 994(p) of title 28, the United States Sentencing Commission shall review and amend the Federal sentencing guidelines and the policy statements of the Commission, as appropriate, to provide an appropriate sentencing enhancement for any crime of violence (as defined in section 16 of title 18) or drug trafficking crime (as defined in section 924(c) of title 18) (including a crime of violence or drug trafficking crime that provides for an enhanced punishment if committed by the use of a deadly or dangerous weapon or device) in which the defendant used body armor.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Sense of Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">It is the sense of Congress that any sentencing enhancement under this subsection should be at least 2 levels.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Omitted</h4>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Donation of Federal surplus body armor</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Definitions</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding sections 541&ndash;555 of title 40, the head of a Federal agency may donate body armor directly to any State or local law enforcement agency, if such body armor&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is in serviceable condition;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) is surplus property; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) meets or exceeds the requirements of National Institute of Justice Standard 0101.03 (as in effect on November 2, 2002).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Notice to Administrator</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The head of a Federal agency who donates body armor under this subsection shall submit to the Administrator of General Services a written notice identifying the amount of body armor donated and each State or local law enforcement agency that received the body armor.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Donation by certain officers</h4>

<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(1) Communities nationwide are struggling to respond to the high numbers of people with mental illnesses involved at all points in the criminal justice system.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(2) A 1999 study by the Department of Justice estimated that 16 percent of people incarcerated in prisons and jails in the United States, which is more than 300,000 people, suffer from mental illnesses.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(3) Los Angeles County Jail and New York's Rikers Island jail complex hold more people with mental illnesses than the largest psychiatric inpatient facilities in the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(4) State prisoners with a mental health problem are twice as likely as those without a mental health problem to have been homeless in the year before their arrest.&quot;</p>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 108&ndash;414, &sect;2, Oct. 30, 2004, 118 Stat. 2327, provided that: &quot;Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(1) According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, over 16 percent of adults incarcerated in United States jails and prisons have a mental illness.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(2) According to the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, approximately 20 percent of youth in the juvenile justice system have serious mental health problems, and a significant number have co-occurring mental health and substance abuse disorders.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(3) According to the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, up to 40 percent of adults who suffer from a serious mental illness will come into contact with the American criminal justice system at some point in their lives.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(4) According to the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, over 150,000 juveniles who come into contact with the juvenile justice system each year meet the diagnostic criteria for at least 1 mental or emotional disorder.</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(6) The majority of individuals with a mental illness or emotional disorder who are involved in the criminal or juvenile justice systems are responsive to medical and psychological interventions that integrate treatment, rehabilitation, and support services.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(7) Collaborative programs between mental health, substance abuse, and criminal or juvenile justice systems that ensure the provision of services for those with mental illness or co-occurring mental illness and substance abuse disorders can reduce the number of such individuals in adult and juvenile corrections facilities, while providing improved public safety.&quot;</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;11101. Findings</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Although the juvenile violent crime arrest rate in 1999 was the lowest in the decade, there remains a consensus that the number of crimes and the rate of offending by juveniles nationwide is still too high.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) According to the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, allowing 1 youth to leave school for a life of crime and of drug abuse costs society $1,700,000 to $2,300,000 annually.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) One in every 6 individuals (16.2 percent) arrested for committing violent crime in 1999 was less than 18 years of age. In 1999, juveniles accounted for 9 percent of murder arrests, 17 percent of forcible rape arrests, 25 percent of robbery arrest, 14 percent of aggravated assault arrests, and 24 percent of weapons arrests.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) More than &#189; of juvenile murder victims are killed with firearms. Of the nearly 1,800 murder victims less than 18 years of age, 17 percent of the victims less than 13 years of age were murdered with a firearm, and 81 percent of the victims 13 years of age or older were killed with a firearm.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Juveniles accounted for 13 percent of all drug abuse violation arrests in 1999. Between 1990 and 1999, juvenile arrests for drug abuse violations rose 132 percent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Over the last 3 decades, youth gang problems have increased nationwide. In the 1970's, 19 States reported youth gang problems. By the late 1990's, all 50 States and the District of Columbia reported gang problems. For the same period, the number of cities reporting youth gang problems grew 843 percent, and the number of counties reporting gang problems increased more than 1,000 percent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) According to a national crime survey of individuals 12 years of age or older during 1999, those 12 to 19 years old are victims of violent crime at higher rates than individuals in all other age groups. Only 30.8 percent of these violent victimizations were reported by youth to police in 1999.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) One-fifth of juveniles 16 years of age who had been arrested were first arrested before attaining 12 years of age. Juveniles who are known to the juvenile justice system before attaining 13 years of age are responsible for a disproportionate share of serious crimes and violence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) The increase in the arrest rates for girls and young juvenile offenders has changed the composition of violent offenders entering the juvenile justice system.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) These problems should be addressed through a 2-track common sense approach that addresses the needs of individual juveniles and society at large by promoting&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) quality prevention programs that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) work with juveniles, their families, local public agencies, and community-based organizations, and take into consideration such factors as whether or not juveniles have been the victims of family violence (including child abuse and neglect); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) are designed to reduce risks and develop competencies in at-risk juveniles that will prevent, and reduce the rate of, violent delinquent behavior; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="note-body"><b>2002</b>&mdash;Pub. L. 107&ndash;273 amended heading and text generally. Prior to amendment, text read as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(a) The Congress hereby finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(1) juveniles accounted for almost half the arrests for serious crimes in the United States in 1974 and for less than one-third of such arrests in 1983;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(2) recent trends show an upsurge in arrests of adolescents for murder, assault, and weapon use;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(3) the small number of youth who commit the most serious and violent offenses are becoming more violent;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(4) understaffed, overcrowded juvenile courts, prosecutorial and public defender offices, probation services, and correctional facilities and inadequately trained staff in such courts, services, and facilities are not able to provide individualized justice or effective help;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(5) present juvenile courts, foster and protective care programs, and shelter facilities are inadequate to meet the needs of children, who, because of this failure to provide effective services, may become delinquents;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(6) existing programs have not adequately responded to the particular problems of the increasing numbers of young people who are addicted to or who abuse alcohol and other drugs, particularly nonopiate or polydrug abusers;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(7) juvenile delinquency can be reduced through programs designed to keep students in elementary and secondary schools through the prevention of unwarranted and arbitrary suspensions and expulsions;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(8) States and local communities which experience directly the devastating failures of the juvenile justice system do not presently have sufficient technical expertise or adequate resources to deal comprehensively with the problems of juvenile delinquency;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(9) existing Federal programs have not provided the direction, coordination, resources, and leadership required to meet the crisis of delinquency;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(10) the juvenile justice system should give additional attention to the problem of juveniles who commit serious crimes, with particular attention given to the areas of sentencing, providing resources necessary for informed dispositions, and rehabilitation;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(11) emphasis should be placed on preventing youth from entering the juvenile justice system to begin with; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(12) the incidence of juvenile delinquency can be reduced through public recreation programs and activities designed to provide youth with social skills, enhance self esteem, and encourage the constructive use of discretionary time.</p>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(b) Congress finds further that the high incidence of delinquency in the United States today results in enormous annual cost and immeasurable loss of human life, personal security, and wasted human resources and that juvenile delinquency constitutes a growing threat to the national welfare requiring immediate and comprehensive action by the Federal Government to reduce and prevent delinquency.&quot;</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) youth who have become homeless or who leave and remain away from home without parental permission, are at risk of developing, and have a disproportionate share of, serious health, behavioral, and emotional problems because they lack sufficient resources to obtain care and may live on the street for extended periods thereby endangering themselves and creating a substantial law enforcement problem for communities in which they congregate;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) many such young people, because of their age and situation, are urgently in need of temporary shelter and services, including services that are linguistically appropriate and acknowledge the environment of youth seeking these services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) services to such young people should be developed and provided using a positive youth development approach that ensures a young person a sense of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) safety and structure;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) belonging and membership;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) self-worth and social contribution;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) independence and control over one's life; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) closeness in interpersonal relationships.<sup><a href="#11201_1_target" name="11201_1">1</a></sup></p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) in view of the interstate nature of the problem, it is the responsibility of the Federal Government to develop an accurate national reporting system to report the problem, and to assist in the development of an effective system of care (including preventive and aftercare services, emergency shelter services, extended residential shelter, and street outreach services) outside the welfare system and the law enforcement system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to make a successful transition to adulthood, runaway youth, homeless youth, and other street youth need opportunities to complete high school or earn a general equivalency degree, learn job skills, and obtain employment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) improved coordination and collaboration between the Federal programs that serve runaway and homeless youth are necessary for the development of a long-term strategy for responding to the needs of this population.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">National Police Athletic/Activities League Youth Enrichment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 106&ndash;367, Oct. 27, 2000, 114 Stat. 1412, as amended by Pub. L. 109&ndash;248, title VI, &sect;&sect;612&ndash;617, July 27, 2006, 120 Stat. 632, 633, provided that:</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&quot;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&quot;This Act may be cited as the &apos;National Police Athletic/Activities League Youth Enrichment Act of 2000&apos;.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&quot;SEC. 2. FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&quot;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(1) The goals of the Police Athletic/Activities League are to&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&quot;(A) increase the academic success of youth participants in PAL programs;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&quot;(B) promote a safe, healthy environment for youth under the supervision of law enforcement personnel where mutual trust and respect can be built;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&quot;(C) develop life enhancing character and leadership skills in young people;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&quot;(D) increase school attendance by providing alternatives to suspensions and expulsions;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&quot;(E) reduce the juvenile crime rate in participating designated communities and the number of police calls involving juveniles during nonschool hours;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&quot;(F) provide youths with alternatives to drugs, alcohol, tobacco, and gang activity;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&quot;(G) create positive communications and interaction between youth and law enforcement personnel; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&quot;(H) prepare youth for the workplace.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(2) The Police Athletic/Activities League, during its 90-year history as a national organization, has proven to be a positive force in the communities it serves.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(3) The Police Athletic/Activities League is a network of 1,700 facilities serving over 3,000 communities. There are 350 PAL chapters throughout the United States, the Virgin Islands, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, serving 2,000,000 youth, ages 5 to 18, nationwide.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(4) Based on PAL chapter demographics, approximately 85 percent of the youths who benefit from PAL programs live in inner cities and urban areas.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(5) PAL chapters are locally operated, volunteer-driven organizations. Although most PAL chapters are sponsored by a law enforcement agency, PAL chapters rarely receive direct funding from law enforcement agencies and are dependent in large part on support from the private sector, such as individuals, business leaders, corporations, and foundations. <!-- PDFPage:299 -->PAL chapters have been exceptionally successful in balancing public funds with private sector donations and maximizing community involvement.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(6) Today's youth face far greater risks than did their parents and grandparents. Law enforcement statistics demonstrate that youth between the ages of 12 and 18 are at risk of committing violent acts and being victims of violent acts between the hours of 3 p.m. and 8 p.m.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(7) Greater numbers of students are dropping out of school and failing in school, even though the consequences of academic failure are more dire in 2005 than ever before.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(8) Many distressed areas in the United States are still underserved by PAL chapters.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&quot;SEC. 3. PURPOSE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&quot;The purpose of this Act is to provide adequate resources in the form of&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(1) assistance for the 342 established PAL chapters to increase of services to the communities they are serving;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(2) seed money for the establishment of 250 (50 per year over a 5-year period) additional local PAL chapters in public housing projects and other distressed areas, including distressed areas with a majority population of Native Americans, by not later than fiscal year 2010; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(3) support of an annual gathering of PAL chapters and designated youth leaders from such chapters to participate in a 3-day conference that addresses national and local issues impacting the youth of America and includes educational sessions to advance character and leadership skills.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&quot;SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.</h4>

<h4 class="note-head">Findings</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 109&ndash;162, title II, &sect;201, Jan. 5, 2006, 119 Stat. 2993, provided that: &quot;Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(1) Nearly 1/3 of American women report physical or sexual abuse by a husband or boyfriend at some point in their lives.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(2) According to the National Crime Victimization Survey, 248,000 Americans 12 years of age and older were raped or sexually assaulted in 2002.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(3) Rape and sexual assault in the United States is estimated to cost $127,000,000,000 per year, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&quot;(A) lost productivity;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&quot;(B) medical and mental health care;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&quot;(C) police and fire services;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&quot;(D) social services;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&quot;(E) loss of and damage to property; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&quot;(F) reduced quality of life.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(4) Nonreporting of sexual assault in rural areas is a particular problem because of the high rate of nonstranger sexual assault.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(5) Geographic isolation often compounds the problems facing sexual assault victims. The lack of anonymity and accessible support services can limit opportunities for justice for victims.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(6) Domestic elder abuse is primarily family abuse. The National Elder Abuse Incidence Study found that the perpetrator was a family member in 90 percent of cases.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(7) Barriers for older victims leaving abusive relationships include&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&quot;(A) the inability to support themselves;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&quot;(B) poor health that increases their dependence on the abuser;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&quot;(C) fear of being placed in a nursing home; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&quot;(D) ineffective responses by domestic abuse programs and law enforcement.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(8) Disabled women comprise another vulnerable population with unmet needs. Women with disabilities are more likely to be the victims of abuse and violence than women without disabilities because of their increased physical, economic, social, or psychological dependence on others.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(9) Many women with disabilities also fail to report the abuse, since they are dependent on their abusers and fear being abandoned or institutionalized.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(10) Of the 598 battered women's programs surveyed&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&quot;(A) only 35 percent of these programs offered disability awareness training for their staff; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&quot;(B) only 16 percent dedicated a staff member to provide services to women with disabilities.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(11) Problems of domestic violence are exacerbated for immigrants when spouses control the immigration status of their family members, and abusers use threats of refusal to file immigration papers and threats to deport spouses and children as powerful tools to prevent battered immigrant women from seeking help, trapping battered immigrant women in violent homes because of fear of deportation.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(12) Battered immigrant women who attempt to flee abusive relationships may not have access to bilingual shelters or bilingual professionals, and face restrictions on public or financial assistance. They may also lack assistance of a certified interpreter in court, when reporting complaints to the police or a 9&ndash;1&ndash;1 operator, or even in acquiring information about their rights and the legal system.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:347 --><p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(13) More than 500 men and women call the National Domestic Violence Hotline every day to get immediate, informed, and confidential assistance to help deal with family violence.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(14) The National Domestic Violence Hotline service is available, toll-free, 24 hours a day and 7 days a week, with bilingual staff, access to translators in 150 languages, and a TTY line for the hearing-impaired.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(15) With access to over 5,000 shelters and service providers across the United States, Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin Islands, the National Domestic Violence Hotline provides crisis intervention and immediately connects callers with sources of help in their local community.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(16) Approximately 60 percent of the callers indicate that calling the Hotline is their first attempt to address a domestic violence situation and that they have not called the police or any other support services.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(17) Between 2000 and 2003, there was a 27 percent increase in call volume at the National Domestic Violence Hotline.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(18) Improving technology infrastructure at the National Domestic Violence Hotline and training advocates, volunteers, and other staff on upgraded technology will drastically increase the Hotline's ability to answer more calls quickly and effectively.&quot;</p>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 109&ndash;162, title III, &sect;301, Jan. 5, 2006, 119 Stat. 3003, provided that: &quot;Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(1) Youth, under the age of 18, account for 67 percent of all sexual assault victimizations reported to law enforcement officials.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(2) The Department of Justice consistently finds that young women between the ages of 16 and 24 experience the highest rate of non-fatal intimate partner violence.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(3) In 1 year, over 4,000 incidents of rape or sexual assault occurred in public schools across the country.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(4) Young people experience particular obstacles to seeking help. They often do not have access to money, transportation, or shelter services. They must overcome issues such as distrust of adults, lack of knowledge about available resources, or pressure from peers and parents.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(5) A needs assessment on teen relationship abuse for the State of California, funded by the California Department of Health Services, identified a desire for confidentiality and confusion about the law as 2 of the most significant barriers to young victims of domestic and dating violence seeking help.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(6) Only one State specifically allows for minors to petition the court for protection orders.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(7) Many youth are involved in dating relationships, and these relationships can include the same kind of domestic violence and dating violence seen in the adult population. In fact, more than 40 percent of all incidents of domestic violence involve people who are not married.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(8) 40 percent of girls ages 14 to 17 report knowing someone their age who has been hit or beaten by a boyfriend, and 13 percent of college women report being stalked.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(9) Of college women who said they had been the victims of rape or attempted rape, 12.8 percent of completed rapes, 35 percent of attempted rapes, and 22.9 percent of threatened rapes took place on a date. Almost 60 percent of the completed rapes that occurred on campus took place in the victim's residence.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(10) According to a 3-year study of student-athletes at 10 Division I universities, male athletes made up only 3.3 percent of the general male university population, but they accounted for 19 percent of the students reported for sexual assault and 35 percent of domestic violence perpetrators.&quot;</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Establishment of the White House Task Force To Address Online Harassment and Abuse</h4>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum of President of the United States, June 16, 2022, 87 F.R. 37431, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies</p>
<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to improve efforts to prevent and address online harassment and abuse, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <i>Policy</i>. Technology platforms and social media can be vital tools for expression, civic participation, and building a sense of community. But the scale, reach, and amplification effects of technology platforms have also exacerbated gender-based violence, particularly through online harassment and abuse. Online harassment and abuse include a broad array of harmful and sometimes illegal behaviors that are perpetrated through the use of technology. Women, adolescent girls, and LGBTQI+ individuals, who may be additionally targeted because of their race, ethnicity, religion, and other factors, can experience more severe harms from online harassment and abuse. Online harassment and abuse take many forms, including the non-consensual distribution of intimate digital images; cyberstalking; sextortion; doxing; malicious deep fakes; gendered disinformation; rape and death threats; the online recruitment and exploitation of victims of sex trafficking; and various forms of technology-facilitated intimate partner abuse. In the United States, 1 in 3 women under the age of 35 reports having been sexually harassed online, and over half of LGBTQI+ individuals report having been the target of severe online abuse, including sustained harassment, physical threats, and stalking in addition to sexual harassment. Globally, half of girls report that they are more likely to be harassed through social media than on the street.</p>
<p class="note-body">In the United States and around the world, women and LGBTQI+ political leaders, public figures, activists, and journalists are especially targeted by sexualized forms of online harassment and abuse, undermining their ability to exercise their human rights and participate in democracy, governance, and civic life. Online abuse and harassment, which aim to preclude women from political decision-making about their own lives and communities, undermine the functioning of democracy. Growing evidence also demonstrates that online radicalization can be linked to gender-based violence, which, along with other forms of abuse and harassment, spans the digital and physical realms. Online harassment and abuse can result in a range of dire consequences for victims, from psychological distress and self-censorship to economic losses, disruptions to education, increased self-harm, suicide, homicide, and other forms of physical and sexual violence. Further, digital technologies are often used in concert with other forms of abuse and harassment, underscoring the urgency of addressing the interplay of in-person and online harms. More research is needed to fully understand the nature, magnitude, and costs of these harms and ways to address them in the United States and globally.</p>
<p class="note-body">Therefore, I am directing the Director of the White House Gender Policy Council and the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs to lead an interagency effort to address online harassment and abuse, specifically focused on technology-facilitated gender-based violence, and to develop concrete recommendations to improve prevention, response, and protection efforts through programs and policies in the United States and globally.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) develop model legislation that will provide the maximum protection possible for the confidentiality of such communications, within any applicable constitutional limits, taking into account the following factors:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the danger that counseling programs for victims of sexual assault and domestic violence will be unable to achieve their goal of helping victims recover from the trauma associated with these crimes if there is no assurance that the records of the counseling sessions will be kept confidential;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) consideration of the appropriateness of an absolute privilege for communications between victims of sexual assault or domestic violence and their therapists or trained counselors, in light of the likelihood that such an absolute privilege will provide the maximum guarantee of confidentiality but also in light of the possibility that such an absolute privilege may be held to violate the rights of criminal defendants under the Federal or State constitutions by denying them the opportunity to obtain exculpatory evidence and present it at trial; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) consideration of what limitations on the disclosure of confidential communications between victims of these crimes and their counselors, short of an absolute privilege, are most likely to ensure that the counseling programs will not be undermined, and specifically whether no such disclosure should be allowed unless, at a minimum, there has been a particularized showing by a criminal defendant of a compelling need for records of such communications, and adequate procedural safeguards are in place to prevent unnecessary or damaging disclosures; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Pursuant to the affirmative power of Congress to enact this part under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution, as well as under section 8 of Article I of the Constitution, it is the purpose of this part to protect the civil rights of victims of gender motivated violence and to promote public safety, health, and activities affecting interstate commerce by establishing a Federal civil rights cause of action for victims of crimes of violence motivated by gender.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Right to be free from crimes of violence</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">All persons within the United States shall have the right to be free from crimes of violence motivated by gender (as defined in subsection (d)).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Cause of action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A person (including a person who acts under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage of any State) who commits a crime of violence motivated by gender and thus deprives another of the right declared in subsection (b) shall be liable to the party injured, in an action for the recovery of compensatory and punitive damages, injunctive and declaratory relief, and such other relief as a court may deem appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the term &quot;crime of violence motivated by gender&quot; means a crime of violence committed because of gender or on the basis of gender, and due, at least in part, to an animus based on the victim's gender; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the term &quot;crime of violence&quot; means&mdash;&#160;<sup><a href="#12361_1_target" name="12361_1">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) an act or series of acts that would constitute a felony against the person or that would constitute a felony against property if the conduct presents a serious risk of physical injury to another, and that would come within the meaning of State or Federal offenses described in section 16 of title 18, whether or not those acts have actually resulted in criminal charges, prosecution, or conviction and whether or not those acts were committed in the special maritime, territorial, or prison jurisdiction of the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) includes an act or series of acts that would constitute a felony described in subparagraph (A) but for the relationship between the person who takes such action and the individual against whom such action is taken.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Limitation and procedures</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this section entitles a person to a cause of action under subsection (c) for random acts of violence unrelated to gender or for acts that cannot be demonstrated, by a preponderance of the evidence, to be motivated by gender (within the meaning of subsection (d)).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) No prior criminal action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this section requires a prior criminal complaint, prosecution, or conviction to establish the elements of a cause of action under subsection (c).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Concurrent jurisdiction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Federal and State courts shall have concurrent jurisdiction over actions brought pursuant to this part.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Supplemental jurisdiction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Neither section 1367 of title 28 nor subsection (c) of this section shall be construed, by reason of a claim arising under such subsection, to confer on the courts of the United States jurisdiction over any State law claim seeking <!-- PDFPage:358 -->the establishment of a divorce, alimony, equitable distribution of marital property, or child custody decree.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) children exposed to domestic violence are more likely to believe that using violence is an effective means of getting one's needs met and managing conflict in close relationships;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) children exposed to abusive parenting, harsh or erratic discipline, or domestic violence are at increased risk for juvenile crime; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) in a national survey of more than 6,000 American families, 50 percent of men who frequently assaulted their wives also frequently abused their children.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;12471. Findings</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds that:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) There is a strong link between domestic violence and homelessness. Among cities surveyed, 44 percent identified domestic violence as a primary cause of homelessness.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Ninety-two percent of homeless women have experienced severe physical or sexual abuse at some point in their lives. Of all homeless women and children, 60 percent had been abused by age 12, and 63 percent have been victims of intimate partner violence as adults.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:373 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Women and families across the country are being discriminated against, denied access to, and even evicted from public and subsidized housing because of their status as victims of domestic violence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) A recent survey of legal service providers around the country found that these providers have responded to almost 150 documented eviction cases in the last year alone where the tenant was evicted because of the domestic violence crimes committed against her. In addition, nearly 100 clients were denied housing because of their status as victims of domestic violence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Women who leave their abusers frequently lack adequate emergency shelter options. The lack of adequate emergency options for victims presents a serious threat to their safety and the safety of their children. Requests for emergency shelter by homeless women with children increased by 78 percent of United States cities surveyed in 2004. In the same year, 32 percent of the requests for shelter by homeless families went unmet due to the lack of available emergency shelter beds.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The average stay at an emergency shelter is 60 days, while the average length of time it takes a homeless family to secure housing is 6 to 10 months.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Victims of domestic violence often return to abusive partners because they cannot find long-term housing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) There are not enough Federal housing rent vouchers available to accommodate the number of people in need of long-term housing. Some people remain on the waiting list for Federal housing rent vouchers for years, while some lists are closed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) Transitional housing resources and services provide an essential continuum between emergency shelter provision and independent living. A majority of women in transitional housing programs stated that had these programs not existed, they would have likely gone back to abusive partners.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) Because abusers frequently manipulate finances in an effort to control their partners, victims often lack steady income, credit history, landlord references, and a current address, all of which are necessary to obtain long-term permanent housing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) Victims of domestic violence in rural areas face additional barriers, challenges, and unique circumstances, such as geographical isolation, poverty, lack of public transportation systems, shortages of health care providers, under-insurance or lack of health insurance, difficulty ensuring confidentiality in small communities, and decreased access to many resources (such as advanced education, job opportunities, and adequate childcare).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) Congress and the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development have recognized in recent years that families experiencing domestic violence have unique needs that should be addressed by those administering the Federal housing programs.</p>

<!-- field-end:effectivedate-amendment-note -->
<!-- field-start:miscellaneous-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Findings</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 117&ndash;103, div. W, title VII, &sect;701, Mar. 15, 2022, 136 Stat. 889, provided that: &quot;Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(1) Over 1 in 3 women experience sexual violence, and 1 in 5 women have survived completed or attempted rape. Such violence has a devastating impact on women's physical and emotional health, financial security, and ability to maintain their jobs, and thus impacts interstate commerce and economic security.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(2) Homicide is one of the leading causes of death for women on the job. Domestic partners or relatives commit 43 percent of workplace homicides against women. One study found that intimate partner violence resulted in 142 homicides among women at work in the United States from 2003 to 2008, a figure which represents 22 percent of the 648 workplace homicides among women during the period. In fact, in 2010, homicides against women at work increased by 13 percent despite continuous declines in overall workplace homicides in recent years.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:386 --><p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(3) Violence can have a dramatic impact on the survivor of such violence. Studies indicate that 44 percent of surveyed employed adults experienced the effect of domestic violence in the workplace, and 64 percent indicated their workplace performance was affected by such violence. Another recent survey found that 78 percent of offenders used workplace resources to express anger, check up on, pressure, or threaten a survivor. Sexual assault, whether occurring in or out of the workplace, can impair an employee's work performance, require time away from work, and undermine the employee's ability to maintain a job. Nearly 50 percent of sexual assault survivors lose their jobs or are forced to quit in the aftermath of the assaults.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(4) Studies find that 60 percent of single women lack economic security and 81 percent of households with single mothers live in economic insecurity. Significant barriers that survivors confront include access to housing, transportation, and child care. Ninety-two percent of homeless women have experienced domestic violence, and more than 50 percent of such women cite domestic violence as the direct cause for homelessness. Survivors are deprived of their autonomy, liberty, and security, and face tremendous threats to their health and safety.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(5) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that survivors of severe intimate partner violence lose nearly 8,000,000 days of paid work, which is the equivalent of more than 32,000 full-time jobs and almost 5,600,000 days of household productivity each year. Therefore, women disproportionately need time off to care for their health or to find safety solutions, such as obtaining a restraining order or finding housing, to avoid or prevent further violence.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(6) Annual costs of intimate partner violence are estimated to be more than $8,300,000,000. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the costs of intimate partner violence against women in 1995 exceeded an estimated $5,800,000,000. These costs included nearly $4,100,000,000 in the direct costs of medical and mental health care and nearly $1,800,000,000 in the indirect costs of lost productivity. These statistics are generally considered to be underestimated because the costs associated with the criminal justice system are not included.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(7) Fifty-five percent of senior executives recently surveyed said domestic violence has a harmful effect on their company's productivity, and more than 70 percent said domestic violence negatively affects attendance. Seventy-eight percent of human resources professionals consider partner violence a workplace issue. However, more than 70 percent of United States workplaces have no formal program or policy that addresses workplace violence, let alone domestic violence. In fact, only 4 percent of employers provided training on domestic violence.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(8) Harassment is a persistent and significant problem in the workplace in the United States, and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission found that not less than 25 percent, and as many as 85 percent, of women surveyed report having experienced sexual harassment at work.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(9) For decades, survivors of sexual violence have come forward to seek justice and demand their right to be free from violence, harassment, and other forms of discrimination. These calls for change reached a tipping point after October 2017 as a result of Tarana Burke's work and #MeToo going viral. Thousands of courageous individuals, from Hollywood to the halls of Congress and the military, to restaurants, agricultural fields, and factory floors, shined a light on the pervasive and insidious nature of workplace harassment and sexual assault.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(10) Working people can be subjected to multiple forms of harassment in the workplace at the same time.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(11) According to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, approximately 3 out of 4 individuals who experience harassment never talked to a supervisor, manager, or union representative about the harassing conduct.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(12) The impact of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking on the workplace is a part of the challenge of workplace harassment.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(13) Studies indicate that one of the best predictors of whether a survivor will be able to stay away from his or her abuser is the degree of his or her economic independence. However, domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking often negatively impact a survivor's ability to maintain employment.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(14) Abusers frequently seek to exert financial control over their partners by actively interfering with their ability to work, including preventing their partners from going to work, harassing their partners at work, limiting their partners&apos; access to cash or transportation, and sabotaging their partners&apos; child care arrangements.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(15) Economic abuse refers to behaviors that control an intimate partner's ability to acquire, use, and maintain access to money, credit, ownership of assets, or governmental or private financial benefits, including defaulting on joint obligations (such as school loans, credit card debt, mortgages, or rent). Other forms of such abuse may include preventing someone from attending school, threatening to or actually terminating employment, controlling or withholding access to cash, checking, or credit accounts, and attempting to damage or sabotage the creditworthiness of an intimate partner, including forcing an intimate partner to write bad checks, forcing an intimate partner to default on payments related to household needs, such as housing, or forcing an intimate partner into bankruptcy.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(16) This title aims to empower survivors of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking to be free from violence, hardship, and control, which restrains basic human rights to freedom and safety in the United States.&quot;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Irrelevancy of population density</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The President shall not limit declarations made under this section to highly populated centers of violent crime or drug trafficking, drug smuggling, or drug use, but shall also consider applications from governments of less populated areas where the magnitude and severity of such activities is beyond the capability of the State or local government to respond.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As part of a request for a declaration under this section, and as a prerequisite to Federal violent crime or drug emergency assistance under this section, the chief executive officer of a State or local government shall&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The President may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) direct any Federal agency, with or without reimbursement, to utilize its authorities and the resources granted to it under Federal law (including personnel, equipment, supplies, facilities, financial assistance, and managerial, technical, and advisory services) in support of State and local assistance efforts; and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Duration of Federal assistance</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) meet the requirements for admission as a trainee of the State or local police force to which the participant will be assigned pursuant to section 12559(5) of this title, including achievement of satisfactory scores on any applicable examination, except that failure to meet the age requirement for a trainee of the State or local police shall not disqualify the applicant if the applicant will be of sufficient age upon completing an undergraduate course of study;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Publication of quality assurance and proficiency testing standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) Not later than 180 days after September 13, 1994, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation shall appoint an advisory board on DNA quality assurance methods from among nominations proposed by the head of the National Academy of Sciences and professional societies of crime laboratory officials.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The advisory board shall include as members scientists from State, local, and private fo<!-- PDFPage:405 -->rensic laboratories, molecular geneticists and population geneticists not affiliated with a forensic laboratory, and a representative from the National Institute of Standards and Technology.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The advisory board shall develop, and if appropriate, periodically revise, recommended standards for quality assurance, including standards for testing the proficiency of forensic laboratories, and forensic analysts, in conducting analyses of DNA.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, after taking into consideration such recommended standards, shall issue (and revise from time to time) standards for quality assurance, including standards for testing the proficiency of forensic laboratories, and forensic analysts, in conducting analyses of DNA.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The standards described in paragraphs (1) and (2) shall specify criteria for quality assurance and proficiency tests to be applied to the various types of DNA analyses used by forensic laboratories. The standards shall also include a system for grading proficiency testing performance to determine whether a laboratory is performing acceptably.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Until such time as the advisory board has made recommendations to the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Director has acted upon those recommendations, the quality assurance guidelines adopted by the technical working group on DNA analysis methods shall be deemed the Director's standards for purposes of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) In addition to issuing standards as provided in paragraphs (1) through (4), the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation shall issue standards and procedures for the use of Rapid DNA instruments and resulting DNA analyses.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In this Act, the term &quot;Rapid DNA instruments&quot; means instrumentation that carries out a fully automated process to derive a DNA analysis from a DNA sample.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Administration of advisory board</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) For administrative purposes, the advisory board appointed under subsection (a) shall be considered an advisory board to the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Section 1013 of title 5 shall not apply with respect to the advisory board appointed under subsection (a).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The DNA advisory board established under this section shall be separate and distinct from any other advisory board administered by the FBI, and is to be administered separately.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The board shall cease to exist on the date 5 years after the initial appointments are made to the board, unless the existence of the board is extended by the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Proficiency testing program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Not later than 1 year after the effective date of this Act,<sup><a href="#12591_1_target" name="12591_1">1</a></sup> the Director of the National Institute of Justice shall certify to the Committees on the Judiciary of the House and Senate that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the Institute has entered into a contract with, or made a grant to, an appropriate entity for establishing, or has taken other appropriate action to ensure that there is established, not later than 2 years after September 13, 1994, a blind external proficiency testing program for DNA analyses, which shall be available to public and private laboratories performing forensic DNA analyses;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a blind external proficiency testing program for DNA analyses is already readily available to public and private laboratories performing forensic DNA analyses; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) it is not feasible to have blind external testing for DNA forensic analyses.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) As used in this subsection, the term &quot;blind external proficiency test&quot; means a test that is presented to a forensic laboratory through a second agency and appears to the analysts to involve routine evidence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Attorney General shall make available to the Director of the National Institute of Justice during the first fiscal year in which funds are distributed under this subtitle up to $250,000 from the funds available under part X of Title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 [34 U.S.C. 10511 et seq.] to carry out this subsection.</p>
