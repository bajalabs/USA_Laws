<h3 class="section-head">&sect;3006A. Adequate representation of defendants</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Choice of Plan</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Each United States district court, with the approval of the judicial council of the circuit, shall place in operation throughout the district a plan for furnishing representation for any person financially unable to obtain adequate representation in accordance with this section. Representation under each plan shall include counsel and investigative, expert, and other services necessary for adequate representation. Each plan shall provide the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Representation shall be provided for any financially eligible person who&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is charged with a felony or a Class A misdemeanor;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) is a juvenile alleged to have committed an act of juvenile delinquency as defined in section 5031 of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) is charged with a violation of probation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) is under arrest, when such representation is required by law;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) is charged with a violation of supervised release or faces modification, reduction, or enlargement of a condition, or extension or revocation of a term of supervised release;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) is subject to a mental condition hearing under chapter 313 of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) is in custody as a material witness;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) is entitled to appointment of counsel under the sixth amendment to the Constitution;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) faces loss of liberty in a case, and Federal law requires the appointment of counsel; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(J) is entitled to the appointment of counsel under section 4109 of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Whenever the United States magistrate judge or the court determines that the interests of justice so require, representation may be provided for any financially eligible person who&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is charged with a Class B or C misdemeanor, or an infraction for which a sentence to confinement is authorized; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) is seeking relief under section 2241, 2254, or 2255 of title 28.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Private attorneys shall be appointed in a substantial proportion of the cases. Each plan may include, in addition to the provisions for private attorneys, either of the following or both:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Attorneys furnished by a bar association or a legal aid agency,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Attorneys furnished by a defender organization established in accordance with the provisions of subsection (g).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Prior to approving the plan for a district, the judicial council of the circuit shall supplement the plan with provisions for representation on appeal. The district court may modify the plan at any time with the approval of the judicial council of the circuit. It shall modify the plan when directed by the judicial council of the circuit. The district court shall notify the Administrative Office of the United States Courts of any modification of its plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Appointment of Counsel</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Counsel furnishing representation under the plan shall be selected from a panel of attorneys designated or approved by the court, or from a bar association, legal aid agency, or defender organization furnishing representation pursuant to the plan. In every case in which a person entitled to representation under a plan approved under subsection (a) appears without counsel, the United <!-- PDFPage:672 -->States magistrate judge or the court shall advise the person that he has the right to be represented by counsel and that counsel will be appointed to represent him if he is financially unable to obtain counsel. Unless the person waives representation by counsel, the United States magistrate judge or the court, if satisfied after appropriate inquiry that the person is financially unable to obtain counsel, shall appoint counsel to represent him. Such appointment may be made retroactive to include any representation furnished pursuant to the plan prior to appointment. The United States magistrate judge or the court shall appoint separate counsel for persons having interests that cannot properly be represented by the same counsel, or when other good cause is shown.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Duration and Substitution of Appointments</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A person for whom counsel is appointed shall be represented at every stage of the proceedings from his initial appearance before the United States magistrate judge or the court through appeal, including ancillary matters appropriate to the proceedings. If at any time after the appointment of counsel the United States magistrate judge or the court finds that the person is financially able to obtain counsel or to make partial payment for the representation, it may terminate the appointment of counsel or authorize payment as provided in subsection (f), as the interests of justice may dictate. If at any stage of the proceedings, including an appeal, the United States magistrate judge or the court finds that the person is financially unable to pay counsel whom he had retained, it may appoint counsel as provided in subsection (b) and authorize payment as provided in subsection (d), as the interests of justice may dictate. The United States magistrate judge or the court may, in the interests of justice, substitute one appointed counsel for another at any stage of the proceedings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Payment for Representation.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) <cap-smallcap>Hourly Rate</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Any attorney appointed pursuant to this section or a bar association or legal aid agency or community defender organization which has provided the appointed attorney shall, at the conclusion of the representation or any segment thereof, be compensated at a rate not exceeding $60 per hour for time expended in court or before a United States magistrate judge and $40 per hour for time reasonably expended out of court, unless the Judicial Conference determines that a higher rate of not in excess of $75 per hour is justified for a circuit or for particular districts within a circuit, for time expended in court or before a United States magistrate judge and for time expended out of court. The Judicial Conference shall develop guidelines for determining the maximum hourly rates for each circuit in accordance with the preceding sentence, with variations by district, where appropriate, taking into account such factors as the minimum range of the prevailing hourly rates for qualified attorneys in the district in which the representation is provided and the recommendations of the judicial councils of the circuits. Not less than 3 years after the effective date of the Criminal Justice Act Revision of 1986, the Judicial Conference is authorized to raise the maximum hourly rates specified in this paragraph up to the aggregate of the overall average percentages of the adjustments in the rates of pay under the General Schedule made pursuant to section 5305&#160;<sup><a href="#3006A_1_target" name="3006A_1">1</a></sup> of title 5 on or after such effective date. After the rates are raised under the preceding sentence, such maximum hourly rates may be raised at intervals of not less than 1 year each, up to the aggregate of the overall average percentages of such adjustments made since the last raise was made under this paragraph. Attorneys may be reimbursed for expenses reasonably incurred, including the costs of transcripts authorized by the United States magistrate&#160;<sup><a href="#3006A_2_target" name="3006A_2">2</a></sup> or the court, and the costs of defending actions alleging malpractice of counsel in furnishing representational services under this section. No reimbursement for expenses in defending against malpractice claims shall be made if a judgment of malpractice is rendered against the counsel furnishing representational services under this section. The United States magistrate&#160;<sup><a href="#3006A_2_target" name="3006A_2">2</a></sup> or the court shall make determinations relating to reimbursement of expenses under this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) <cap-smallcap>Maximum Amounts</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For representation of a defendant before the United States magistrate judge or the district court, or both, the compensation to be paid to an attorney or to a bar association or legal aid agency or community defender organization shall not exceed $7,000 for each attorney in a case in which one or more felonies are charged, and $2,000 for each attorney in a case in which only misdemeanors are charged. For representation of a defendant in an appellate court, the compensation to be paid to an attorney or to a bar association or legal aid agency or community defender organization shall not exceed $5,000 for each attorney in each court. For representation of a petitioner in a non-capital habeas corpus proceeding, the compensation for each attorney shall not exceed the amount applicable to a felony in this paragraph for representation of a defendant before a judicial officer of the district court. For representation of such petitioner in an appellate court, the compensation for each attorney shall not exceed the amount applicable for representation of a defendant in an appellate court. For representation of an offender before the United States Parole Commission in a proceeding under section 4106A of this title, the compensation shall not exceed $1,500 for each attorney in each proceeding; for representation of an offender in an appeal from a determination of such Commission under such section, the compensation shall not exceed $5,000 for each attorney in each court. For any other representation required or authorized by this section, the compensation shall not exceed $1,500 for each attorney in each proceeding. The compensation maximum amounts provided in this paragraph shall increase simultaneously by the same percentage, rounded to the nearest multiple of $100, as the aggregate percentage increases in the maximum hourly compensation rate paid pursuant to paragraph (1) for time expended since the case maximum amounts were last adjusted.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:673 --><p class="statutory-body">(3) <cap-smallcap>Waiving Maximum Amounts</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Payment in excess of any maximum amount provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection may be made for extended or complex representation whenever the court in which the representation was rendered, or the United States magistrate judge if the representation was furnished exclusively before him, certifies that the amount of the excess payment is necessary to provide fair compensation and the payment is approved by the chief judge of the circuit. The chief judge of the circuit may delegate such approval authority to an active or senior circuit judge.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) <cap-smallcap>Disclosure of fees.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Subject to subparagraphs (B) through (E), the amounts paid under this subsection for services in any case shall be made available to the public by the court upon the court's approval of the payment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Pre-trial or trial in progress</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If a trial is in pre-trial status or still in progress and after considering the defendant's interests as set forth in subparagraph (D), the court shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) redact any detailed information on the payment voucher provided by defense counsel to justify the expenses to the court; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) make public only the amounts approved for payment to defense counsel by dividing those amounts into the following categories:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) Arraignment and or plea.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) Bail and detention hearings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(III) Motions.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) <cap-smallcap>Trial completed.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If a request for payment is not submitted until after the completion of the trial and subject to consideration of the defendant's interests as set forth in subparagraph (D), the court shall make available to the public an unredacted copy of the expense voucher.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) <cap-smallcap>Protection of the rights of the defendant</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the court determines that defendant's interests as set forth in subparagraph (D) require a limited disclosure, the court shall disclose amounts as provided in subparagraph (B).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) <cap-smallcap>Considerations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The interests referred to in subparagraphs (B) and (C) are&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) to protect any person's 5th amendment right against self-incrimination;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) to protect the defendant's 6th amendment rights to effective assistance of counsel;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) the defendant's attorney-client privilege;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) the work product privilege of the defendant's counsel;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(v) the safety of any person; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(vi) any other interest that justice may require, except that the amount of the fees shall not be considered a reason justifying any limited disclosure under section 3006A(d)(4) of title 18, United States Code.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) <cap-smallcap>Notice</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The court shall provide reasonable notice of disclosure to the counsel of the defendant prior to the approval of the payments in order to allow the counsel to request redaction based on the considerations set forth in subparagraph (D). Upon completion of the trial, the court shall release unredacted copies of the vouchers provided by defense counsel to justify the expenses to the court. If there is an appeal, the court shall not release unredacted copies of the vouchers provided by defense counsel to justify the expenses to the court until such time as the appeals process is completed, unless the court determines that none of the defendant's interests set forth in subparagraph (D) will be compromised.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) <cap-smallcap>Effective date</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The amendment made by paragraph (4) shall become effective 60 days after enactment of this Act, will apply only to cases filed on or after the effective date, and shall be in effect for no longer than 24 months after the effective date.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5) <cap-smallcap>Filing Claims</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A separate claim for compensation and reimbursement shall be made to the district court for representation before the United States magistrate judge and the court, and to each appellate court before which the attorney provided representation to the person involved. Each claim shall be supported by a sworn written statement specifying the time expended, services rendered, and expenses incurred while the case was pending before the United States magistrate judge and the court, and the compensation and reimbursement applied for or received in the same case from any other source. The court shall fix the compensation and reimbursement to be paid to the attorney or to the bar association or legal aid agency or community defender organization which provided the appointed attorney.

<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &sect;148, and on sections 264(x) and 986 of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking (Dec. 23, 1913, ch. 6, &sect;12B, subsection (x), as added June 16, 1933, ch. 89, &sect;8, 48 Stat. 178; July 17, 1916, ch. 245, &sect;31, sixth paragraph, 39 Stat. 382 (384); Dec. 11, 1926, ch. 2, &sect;3, 44 Stat. 918; Aug. 23, 1935, ch. 614, &sect;101, 49 Stat. 684, 703).</p>
<p class="note-body">Section consolidates said section 148 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., and said sections 264(x) and 986 of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking.</p>
<p class="note-body">Said section 148 of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, was concerned with offenses relating to counterfeiting and passing, etc., of transportation requests and to the unlawful possession or making of plates, stones, etc., used in making such requests, which were defined in sections 146 and 147 of said title 18, now sections 508 and 509 of this title.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:689 --><p class="note-body">Said sections 264(x) and 986 of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, were concerned with various offenses as defined in sections 981&ndash;985, 987 of said title 12, relating to Federal land banks, joint-stock land banks and national farm loan associations, and as defined in section 264 of said title 12 relating to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. All of the provisions of said sections 981&ndash;985, 987 of said title 12, and the criminal provisions of said section 264 of said title 12, were transferred to this title where they were, in some instances, consolidated with similar provisions from other sections. Such provisions are now incorporated in sections 218, 221, 433, 493, 657, 709, 1006, 1007, 1011, 1013, 1014, 1907, and 1909 of this title. In most instances, these sections, as the result of the consolidations, relate to other organizations as well as those mentioned above, but, by enumerating the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Federal land banks, joint-stock land banks, and national farm loan associations in this section, the powers of the Secret Service are not broadened beyond what they were in said sections 264(x) and 986 of said title 12.</p>
<p class="note-body">In this section, the wording of said section 148 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., and section 986 of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking reading &quot;The Secretary of the Treasury is hereby authorized to direct and use the Secret Service Division of the Treasury Department&quot; was adopted, rather than the wording of said section 264(x) of said title 12, which read &quot;The Secret Service Division of the Treasury Department is authorized.&quot;</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &quot;of the United States marshal having jurisdiction&quot;, following &quot;custody&quot; in all three of said sections, were omitted as surplusage.</p>
<p class="note-body">Changes were made in phraseology.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the defendant is to be tried upon an indictment or information dismissed by a trial court and reinstated following an appeal, the trial shall commence within seventy days from the date the action occasioning the trial becomes final, except that the court retrying the case may extend the period for trial not to exceed one hundred and eighty days from the date the action occasioning the trial becomes final if the unavailability of witnesses or other factors resulting from the passage of time shall make trial within seventy days impractical. The periods of delay enumerated in section 3161(h) are excluded in computing the time limitations specified in this section. The sanctions of section 3162 apply to this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) If the defendant is to be tried again following a declaration by the trial judge of a mistrial or following an order of such judge for a new trial, the trial shall commence within seventy days from the date the action occasioning the retrial becomes final. If the defendant is to be tried again following an appeal or a collateral attack, the trial shall commence within seventy days from the date the action occasioning the retrial becomes final, except that the court retrying the case may extend the period for retrial not to exceed one hundred and eighty days from the date the action occasioning the retrial becomes final if unavailability of witnesses or other factors resulting from passage of time shall make trial within seventy days impractical.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Any period of delay resulting from other proceedings concerning the defendant, including but not limited to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) delay resulting from any proceeding, including any examinations, to determine the mental competency or physical capacity of the defendant;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) delay resulting from trial with respect to other charges against the defendant;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) delay resulting from any interlocutory appeal;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) delay resulting from any pretrial motion, from the filing of the motion through the conclusion of the hearing on, or other prompt disposition of, such motion;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) delay resulting from any proceeding relating to the transfer of a case or the removal of any defendant from another district under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) delay resulting from transportation of any defendant from another district, or to and from places of examination or hospitalization, except that any time consumed in excess of ten days from the date an order of removal or an order directing such transportation, and the defendant's arrival at the destination shall be presumed to be unreasonable;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) delay resulting from consideration by the court of a proposed plea agreement to be entered into by the defendant and the attorney for the Government; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) delay reasonably attributable to any period, not to exceed thirty days, during which any proceeding concerning the defendant is actually under advisement by the court.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Any period of delay during which prosecution is deferred by the attorney for the Government pursuant to written agreement with the defendant, with the approval of the court, for the purpose of allowing the defendant to demonstrate his good conduct.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3)(A) Any period of delay resulting from the absence or unavailability of the defendant or an essential witness.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, a defendant or an essential witness shall be considered absent when his whereabouts are unknown and, in addition, he is attempting to avoid apprehension or prosecution or his whereabouts cannot be determined by due diligence. For purposes of such subparagraph, a defendant or an essential witness shall be considered unavailable whenever his whereabouts are known but his presence for trial cannot be obtained by due diligence or he resists appearing at or being returned for trial.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Any period of delay resulting from the fact that the defendant is mentally incompetent or physically unable to stand trial.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) If the information or indictment is dismissed upon motion of the attorney for the Government and thereafter a charge is filed against the defendant for the same offense, or any offense required to be joined with that offense, any period of delay from the date the charge was dismissed to the date the time limitation would commence to run as to the subsequent charge had there been no previous charge.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) A reasonable period of delay when the defendant is joined for trial with a codefendant as to whom the time for trial has not run and no motion for severance has been granted.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7)(A) Any period of delay resulting from a continuance granted by any judge on his own motion or at the request of the defendant or his counsel or at the request of the attorney for the Government, if the judge granted such continuance on the basis of his findings that the ends of justice served by taking such action outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial. No such period of delay resulting from a continuance granted by the court in accordance with this paragraph shall be excludable under this subsection unless the court sets forth, in the record of the case, either orally or in writing, its reasons for finding that the ends of justice served by the granting of such continuance outweigh the best interests of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The factors, among others, which a judge shall consider in determining whether to grant a continuance under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph in any case are as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) Whether the failure to grant such a continuance in the proceeding would be likely to make a continuation of such proceeding impossible, or result in a miscarriage of justice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) Whether the case is so unusual or so complex, due to the number of defendants, the nature of the prosecution, or the existence of novel questions of fact or law, that it is unreasonable to expect adequate preparation for pretrial proceedings or for the trial itself within the time limits established by this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) Whether, in a case in which arrest precedes indictment, delay in the filing of the indictment is caused because the arrest occurs at a time such that it is unreasonable to expect return and filing of the indictment within the period specified in section 3161(b), or because the facts upon which the grand jury must base its determination are unusual or complex.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) Whether the failure to grant such a continuance in a case which, taken as a whole, is not so unusual or so complex as to fall within clause (ii), would deny the defendant reasonable time to obtain counsel, would unreasonably deny the defendant or the Government continuity of counsel, or would deny counsel for the defendant or the attorney for the Government the reasonable time necessary for effective preparation, taking into account the exercise of due diligence.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) No continuance under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall be granted because of general congestion of the court's calendar, or lack of diligent preparation or failure to obtain available witnesses on the part of the attorney for the Government.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) Any period of delay, not to exceed one year, ordered by a district court upon an appli<!-- PDFPage:727 -->cation of a party and a finding by a preponderance of the evidence that an official request, as defined in section 3292 of this title, has been made for evidence of any such offense and that it reasonably appears, or reasonably appeared at the time the request was made, that such evidence is, or was, in such foreign country.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(i) If trial did not commence within the time limitation specified in section 3161 because the defendant had entered a plea of guilty or nolo contendere subsequently withdrawn to any or all charges in an indictment or information, the defendant shall be deemed indicted with respect to all charges therein contained within the meaning of section 3161, on the day the order permitting withdrawal of the plea becomes final.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j)(1) If the attorney for the Government knows that a person charged with an offense is serving a term of imprisonment in any penal institution, he shall promptly&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) undertake to obtain the presence of the prisoner for trial; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) cause a detainer to be filed with the person having custody of the prisoner and request him to so advise the prisoner and to advise the prisoner of his right to demand trial.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the person having custody of such prisoner receives a detainer, he shall promptly advise the prisoner of the charge and of the prisoner's right to demand trial. If at any time thereafter the prisoner informs the person having custody that he does demand trial, such person shall cause notice to that effect to be sent promptly to the attorney for the Government who caused the detainer to be filed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Upon receipt of such notice, the attorney for the Government shall promptly seek to obtain the presence of the prisoner for trial.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) When the person having custody of the prisoner receives from the attorney for the Government a properly supported request for temporary custody of such prisoner for trial, the prisoner shall be made available to that attorney for the Government (subject, in cases of interjurisdictional transfer, to any right of the prisoner to contest the legality of his delivery).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(k)(1) If the defendant is absent (as defined by subsection (h)(3)) on the day set for trial, and the defendant's subsequent appearance before the court on a bench warrant or other process or surrender to the court occurs more than 21 days after the day set for trial, the defendant shall be deemed to have first appeared before a judicial officer of the court in which the information or indictment is pending within the meaning of subsection (c) on the date of the defendant's subsequent appearance before the court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the defendant is absent (as defined by subsection (h)(3)) on the day set for trial, and the defendant's subsequent appearance before the court on a bench warrant or other process or surrender to the court occurs not more than 21 days after the day set for trial, the time limit required by subsection (c), as extended by subsection (h), shall be further extended by 21 days.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) If, in the case of any individual against whom a complaint is filed charging such individual with an offense, no indictment or information is filed within the time limit required by section 3161(b) as extended by section 3161(h) of this chapter, such charge against that individual contained in such complaint shall be dismissed or otherwise dropped. In determining whether to dismiss the case with or without prejudice, the court shall consider, among others, each of the following factors: the seriousness of the offense; the facts and circumstances of the case which led to the dismissal; and the impact of a reprosecution on the administration of this chapter and on the administration of justice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If a defendant is not brought to trial within the time limit required by section 3161(c) as extended by section 3161(h), the information or indictment shall be dismissed on motion of the defendant. The defendant shall have the burden of proof of supporting such motion but the Government shall have the burden of going forward with the evidence in connection with any exclusion of time under subparagraph 3161(h)(3). In determining whether to dismiss the case with or without prejudice, the court shall consider, among others, each of the following factors: the seriousness of the offense; the facts and circumstances of the case which led to the dismissal; and the impact of a reprosecution on the administration of this chapter and on the administration of justice. Failure of the defendant to move for dismissal prior to trial or entry of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere shall constitute a waiver of the right to dismissal under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) In any case in which counsel for the defendant or the attorney for the Government (1) knowingly allows the case to be set for trial without disclosing the fact that a necessary witness would be unavailable for trial; (2) files a motion solely for the purpose of delay which he knows is totally frivolous and without merit; (3) makes a statement for the purpose of obtaining a continuance which he knows to be false and which is material to the granting of a continuance; or (4) otherwise willfully fails to proceed to trial without justification consistent with section 3161 of this chapter, the court may punish any such counsel or attorney, as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) in the case of an appointed defense counsel, by reducing the amount of compensation that otherwise would have been paid to such counsel pursuant to section 3006A of this title in an amount not to exceed 25 per centum thereof;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in the case of a counsel retained in connection with the defense of a defendant, by imposing on such counsel a fine of not to exceed 25 per centum of the compensation to which he is entitled in connection with his defense of such defendant;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) by imposing on any attorney for the Government a fine of not to exceed $250;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) by denying any such counsel or attorney for the Government the right to practice before the court considering such case for a period of not to exceed ninety days; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) by filing a report with an appropriate disciplinary committee.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The authority to punish provided for by this subsection shall be in addition to any other authority or power available to such court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The court shall follow procedures established in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure in punishing any counsel or attorney for the Government pursuant to this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) In the event that any district court is unable to comply with the time limits set forth in section 3161(c) due to the status of its court calendars, the chief judge, where the existing resources are being efficiently utilized, may, after seeking the recommendations of the planning group, apply to the judicial council of the circuit for a suspension of such time limits as provided in subsection (b). The judicial council of the circuit shall evaluate the capabilities of the district, the availability of visiting judges from within and without the circuit, and make any recommendations it deems appropriate to alleviate calendar congestion resulting from the lack of resources.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) If the judicial council of the circuit finds that no remedy for such congestion is reasonably available, such council may, upon application by the chief judge of a district, grant a suspension of the time limits in section 3161(c) in such district for a period of time not to exceed one year for the trial of cases for which indictments or informations are filed during such one-year period. During such period of suspension, the time limits from arrest to indictment, set forth in section 3161(b), shall not be reduced, nor shall the sanctions set forth in section 3162 be suspended; but such time limits from indictment to trial shall not be increased to exceed one hundred and eighty days. The time limits for the trial of cases of detained persons who are being detained solely because they are awaiting trial shall not be affected by the provisions of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) If, prior to July 1, 1980, the chief judge of any district concludes, with the concurrence of the planning group convened in the district, that the district is prepared to implement the provisions of section 3162 in their entirety, he may apply to the judicial council of the circuit in which the district is located to implement such provisions. Such application shall show the degree of compliance in the district with the time limits set forth in subsections (b) and (c) of section 3161 during the twelve-calendar-month period preceding the date of such application and shall contain a proposed order and schedule for such implementation, which includes the date on which the provisions of section 3162 are to become effective in the district, the effect such implementation will have upon such district's practices and procedures, and provision for adequate notice to all interested parties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) After review of any such application, the judicial council of the circuit shall enter an order implementing the provisions of section 3162 in their entirety in the district making application, or shall return such application to the chief judge of such district, together with an explanation setting forth such council's reasons for refusing to enter such order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) The approval of any application made pursuant to subsection (a) or (c) by a judicial council of a circuit shall be reported within ten days to the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, together with a copy of the application, a written report setting forth in sufficient detail the reasons for granting such application, and, in the case of an application made pursuant to subsection (a), a proposal for alleviating congestion in the district.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts shall not later than ten days after receipt transmit such report to the Congress and to the Judicial Conference of the United States. The judicial council of the circuit shall not grant a suspension to any district within six months following the expiration of a prior suspension without the consent of the Congress by Act of Congress. The limitation on granting a suspension made by this paragraph shall not apply with respect to any judicial district in which the prior suspension is in effect on the date of the enactment of the Speedy Trial Act Amendments Act of 1979.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) If the chief judge of the district court concludes that the need for suspension of time limits in such district under this section is of great urgency, he may order the limits suspended for a period not to exceed thirty days. Within ten days of entry of such order, the chief judge shall apply to the judicial council of the circuit for a suspension pursuant to subsection (a).</p>

<h4 class="note-sub-head">&quot;SEC. 201. SHORT TITLE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&quot;This title may be cited as the &apos;Extradition Treaties Interpretation Act of 1998&apos;.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&quot;SEC. 202. FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&quot;Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(1) each year, several hundred children are kidnapped by a parent in violation of law, court order, or legally binding agreement and brought to, or taken from, the United States;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(2) until the mid-1970's, parental abduction generally was not considered a criminal offense in the United States;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(3) since the mid-1970's, United States criminal law has evolved such that parental abduction is now a criminal offense in each of the 50 States and the District of Columbia;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(4) in enacting the International Parental Kidnapping Crime Act of 1993 (Public Law 103&ndash;173; 107 Stat. 1998; 18 U.S.C. 1204), Congress recognized the need to combat parental abduction by making the act of international parental kidnapping a Federal criminal offense;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(5) many of the extradition treaties to which the United States is a party specifically list the offenses that are extraditable and use the word &apos;kidnapping&apos;, but it has been the practice of the United States not to consider the term to include parental abduction because these treaties were negotiated by the United States prior to the development in United States criminal law described in paragraphs (3) and (4);</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(6) the more modern extradition treaties to which the United States is a party contain dual criminality provisions, which provide for extradition where both parties make the offense a felony, and therefore it is the practice of the United States to consider such treaties to include parental abduction if the other foreign state party also considers the act of parental abduction to be a criminal offense; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(7) this circumstance has resulted in a disparity in United States extradition law which should be rectified to better protect the interests of children and their parents.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&quot;SEC. 203. INTERPRETATION OF EXTRADITION TREATIES.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&quot;For purposes of any extradition treaty to which the United States is a party, Congress authorizes the inter<!-- PDFPage:735 -->pretation of the terms &apos;kidnaping&apos; and &apos;kidnapping&apos; to include parental kidnapping.&quot;</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &sect;584 (R.S. &sect;1046; July 5, 1884, ch. 225, &sect;2, 23 Stat. 122).</p>
<p class="note-body">Words &quot;customs laws&quot; were substituted for &quot;revenue laws,&quot; since different limitations are provided for internal revenue violations by section 3748 of title 26, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Internal Revenue Code.</p>
<p class="note-body">This section was held to apply to offenses under the customs laws. Those offenses are within the term &quot;revenue laws&quot; but not within the term &quot;internal revenue laws&quot;. <i>United States v. Hirsch</i> (1879, 100 U.S. 33, 25 L. Ed. 539), <i>United States v. Shorey</i> (1869, Fed. Cas. No. 16,282), and <i>United States v. Platt</i> (1840, Fed. Cas. No. 16,054a) applied this section in customs cases. Hence it appears that there was no proper basis for the complete elimination from section 584 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., of the reference to revenue laws.</p>
<p class="note-body">Meaning of &quot;revenue laws&quot;. <i>United States v. Norton</i> (1876, 91 U.S. 566, 23 L.Ed. 454), quoting Webster that &quot;revenue&quot; refers to &quot;The income of a nation, derived from its taxes, duties, or other sources, for the payment of the national expenses.&quot; Quoting <i>United States v. Mayo</i> (1813, Fed. Cas. No. 15,755) that &quot;revenue laws&quot; meant such laws &quot;as are made for the direct and avowed purpose of creating revenue or public funds for the service of the Government.&quot;</p>
<p class="note-body">Definition of revenue. &quot;Revenue&quot; is the income of a State, and the revenue of the Post Office Department, being raised by a tax on mailable matter conveyed in the mail, and which is disbursed in the public service, is as much a part of the income of the government as moneys collected for duties on imports (<i>United States v. Bromley</i>, 53 U.S. 88, 99, 13 L. Ed. 905).</p>
<p class="note-body">&quot;Revenue&quot; is the product or fruit of taxation. It matters not in what form the power of taxation may be exercised or to what subjects it may be applied, its exercise is intended to provide means for the support of the Government, and the means provided are necessarily to be regarded as the internal revenue. Duties upon imports are imposed for the same general object and, because they are so imposed, the money thus produced is considered revenue, not because it is derived from any particular source (<i>United States v. Wright</i>, 1870, Fed. Cas. No. 16,770).</p>
<p class="note-body">&quot;Revenue law&quot; is defined as a law for direct object of imposing and collecting taxes, dues, imports, and excises for government and its purposes (<i>In re Mendenhall</i>, D.C. Mont. 1935, 10 F. Supp. 122).</p>
<p class="note-body">Act Cong. March 2, 1799, ch. 22, 1 Stat. 627, regulating the collection of duties on imports, is a revenue law, within the meaning of act Cong. April 18, 1818, ch. 70, 3 Stat. 433, providing for the mode of suing for and recovering penalties and forfeitures for violations of the revenue laws of the United States (<i>The Abigail</i>, 1824, Fed. Cas. No. 18).</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., &sect;590a (Aug. 24, 1942, ch. 555, &sect;1, 56 Stat. 747; July 1, 1944, ch. 358, &sect;19(b), 58 Stat. 667; Oct. 3, 1944, ch. 479, &sect;28, 58 Stat. 781).</p>
<p class="note-body">The phrase &quot;when the United States is at war&quot; was inserted at the beginning of this section to make it permanent instead of temporary legislation, and to obviate the necessity of reenacting such legislation in the future. This permitted the elimination of references to dates and to the provision limiting the application of the section to transactions not yet fully barred. When the provisions of the War Contract Settlements Act of 1944, upon which this section is based, are considered in connection with said section 590a which it amends, it is obvious that no purpose can be served now by the provisions omitted.</p>
<p class="note-body">Phrase (2), reading &quot;or committed in connection with the acquisition, care, handling, custody, control or disposition of any real or personal property of the United States&quot; was derived from section 28 of the Surplus Property Act of 1944 which amended said section 590a of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed. This act is temporary by its terms and relates only to offenses committed in the disposition of surplus property thereunder.</p>
<p class="note-body">The revised section extends its provisions to all offenses involving the disposition of any property, real or personal, of the United States. This extension is more apparent than real since phrase (2), added as the result of said Act, was merely a more specific statement of offenses embraced in phrase (1) of this section.</p>
<p class="note-body">The revised section is written in general terms as permanent legislation applicable whenever the United States is at war. (See, also, reviser's note under section 284 of this title.)</p>
<p class="note-body">The last paragraph was added to obviate any possibility of doubt as to meaning of terms defined in section 103 of title 41, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Public Contracts.</p>
<p class="note-body">Changes were made in phraseology.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the report is based upon facts revealed in the course of an investigation authorized by subsection (a) of section 3332 and is supported by the preponderance of the evidence; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) when the report is submitted pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection (a) of this section, each person named therein and any reasonable number of witnesses in his behalf as designated by him to the foreman of the grand jury were afforded an opportunity to testify before the grand jury prior to the filing of such report, and when the report is submitted pursuant to paragraph (2) of subsection (a) of this section, it is not critical of an identified person.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) An order accepting a report pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection (a) of this section and the report shall be sealed by the court and shall not be filed as a public record or be subject to subpena or otherwise made public (i) until at least thirty-one days after a copy of the order and report are served upon each public officer or employee named therein and an answer has been filed or the time for filing an answer has expired, or (ii) if an appeal is taken, until all rights of review of the public officer or employee named therein have expired or terminated in an order accepting the report. No order accepting a report pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection (a) of this section shall be entered until thirty days after the delivery of such report to the public officer or body pursuant to paragraph (3) of subsection (c) of this section. The court may issue such orders as it shall deem appropriate to prevent unauthorized publication of a report. Unauthorized publication may be punished as contempt of the court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Such public officer or employee may file with the clerk a verified answer to such a report not later than twenty days after service of the order and report upon him. Upon a showing of good cause, the court may grant such public officer or employee an extension of time within which to file such answer and may authorize such limited publication of the report as may be necessary to prepare such answer. Such an answer shall plainly and concisely state the facts and law constituting the defense of the public officer or employee to the charges in said report, and, except for those parts thereof which the court determines to have been inserted scandalously, prejudiciously, or unnecessarily, such answer shall become an appendix to the report.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Upon the expiration of the time set forth in paragraph (1) of subsection (c) of this section, the United States attorney shall deliver a true copy of such report, and the appendix, if any, for appropriate action to each public officer or body having jurisdiction, responsibility, or authority over each public officer or employee named in the report.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Upon the submission of a report pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, if the court finds that the filing of such report as a public record may prejudice fair consideration of a pending criminal matter, it shall order such report sealed and such report shall not be subject to subpena or public inspection during the pendency of such criminal matter, except upon order of the court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Whenever the court to which a report is submitted pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection (a) of this section is not satisfied that the report complies with the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, it may direct that additional testimony be taken before the same grand jury, or it shall make an order sealing such report, and it shall not be filed as a public record or be subject to subpena or otherwise made public until the provisions of subsection (b) of this section are met. A special grand jury term may be extended by the district court beyond thirty-six months in order that such additional testimony may be taken or the provisions of subsection (b) of this section may be met.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) As used in this section, &quot;public officer or employee&quot; means any officer or employee of the United States, any State, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, any territory or possession of the United States, or any political subdivision, or any department, agency, or instrumentality thereof.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) When specially designated to exercise such jurisdiction by the district court or courts he serves, any United States magistrate judge shall have jurisdiction to try persons accused of, and sentence persons convicted of, misdemeanors committed within that judicial district.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Any person charged with a misdemeanor, other than a petty offense may elect, however, to be tried before a district judge for the district in which the offense was committed. The magistrate judge shall carefully explain to the defendant that he has a right to trial, judgment, and sentencing by a district judge and that he may have a right to trial by jury before a district judge or magistrate judge. The magistrate judge may not proceed to try the case unless the defendant, after such explanation, expressly consents to be tried before the magistrate judge and expressly and specifically waives trial, judgment, and sentencing by a district judge. Any such consent and waiver shall be made in writing or orally on the record.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) A magistrate judge who exercises trial jurisdiction under this section, and before whom a person is convicted or pleads either guilty or nolo contendere, may, with the approval of a judge of the district court, direct the probation service of the court to conduct a presentence investigation on that person and render a report to the magistrate judge prior to the imposition of sentence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The probation laws shall be applicable to persons tried by a magistrate judge under this section, and such officer shall have power to grant probation and to revoke, modify, or reinstate the probation of any person granted probation by a magistrate judge.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Proceedings before United States magistrate judges under this section shall be taken down by a court reporter or recorded by suitable sound recording equipment. For purposes of appeal a copy of the record of such proceedings shall be made available at the expense of the United States to a person who makes affidavit that he is unable to pay or give security therefor, and the expense of such copy shall be paid <!-- PDFPage:760 -->by the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) The district court may order that proceedings in any misdemeanor case be conducted before a district judge rather than a United States magistrate judge upon the court's own motion or, for good cause shown, upon petition by the attorney for the Government. Such petition should note the novelty, importance, or complexity of the case, or other pertinent factors, and be filed in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Attorney General.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) The magistrate judge may, in a petty offense case involving a juvenile, exercise all powers granted to the district court under chapter 403 of this title. The magistrate judge may, in the case of any misdemeanor, other than a petty offense, involving a juvenile in which consent to trial before a magistrate judge has been filed under subsection (b), exercise all powers granted to the district court under chapter 403 of this title. For purposes of this subsection, proceedings under chapter 403 of this title may be instituted against a juvenile by a violation notice or complaint, except that no such case may proceed unless the certification referred to in section 5032 of this title has been filed in open court at the arraignment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) The magistrate judge shall have power to modify, revoke, or terminate supervised release of any person sentenced to a term of supervised release by a magistrate judge.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) A district judge may designate a magistrate judge to conduct hearings to modify, revoke, or terminate supervised release, including evidentiary hearings, and to submit to the judge proposed findings of fact and recommendations for such modification, revocation, or termination by the judge, including, in the case of revocation, a recommended disposition under section 3583(e) of this title. The magistrate judge shall file his or her proposed findings and recommendations.</p>

Service may be made upon a domestic or foreign corporation or upon a partnership or other unincorporated association which is subject to suit under a common name, by delivering the subpoena to an officer, to a managing or general agent, or to any other agent authorized by appointment or by law to receive service of process. The affidavit of the person serving the subpoena entered on a true copy thereof by the person serving it shall be proof of service.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:766 --><p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Enforcement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In the case of contumacy by or refusal to obey a subpoena issued to any person, the Attorney General may invoke the aid of any court of the United States within the jurisdiction of which the investigation is carried on or of which the subpoenaed person is an inhabitant, or in which he carries on business or may be found, to compel compliance with the subpoena. The court may issue an order requiring the subpoenaed person to appear before the Attorney General to produce records, if so ordered, or to give testimony concerning the production and authentication of such records. Any failure to obey the order of the court may be punished by the court as a contempt thereof. All process in any such case may be served in any judicial district in which such person may be found.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Limitation on Use</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Health information about an individual that is disclosed under this section may not be used in, or disclosed to any person for use in, any administrative, civil, or criminal action or investigation directed against the individual who is the subject of the information unless the action or investigation arises out of and is directly related to receipt of health care or payment for health care or action involving a fraudulent claim related to health; or if authorized by an appropriate order of a court of competent jurisdiction, granted after application showing good cause therefor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In assessing good cause, the court shall weigh the public interest and the need for disclosure against the injury to the patient, to the physician-patient relationship, and to the treatment services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Upon the granting of such order, the court, in determining the extent to which any disclosure of all or any part of any record is necessary, shall impose appropriate safeguards against unauthorized disclosure.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) The testimony of any witness in a foreign country may be taken either on oral or written <!-- PDFPage:768 -->interrogatories, or on interrogatories partly oral and partly written, pursuant to a commission issued, as hereinafter provided, for the purpose of determining whether any foreign documents sought to be used in any criminal action or proceeding in any court of the United States are genuine, and whether the authentication requirements of the Federal Rules of Evidence are satisfied with respect to any such document (or the original thereof in case such document is a copy). Application for the issuance of a commission for such purpose may be made to the court in which such action or proceeding is pending by the United States or any other party thereto, after five days&apos; notice in writing by the applicant party, or his attorney, to the opposite party, or his attorney of record, which notice shall state the names and addresses of witnesses whose testimony is to be taken and the time when it is desired to take such testimony. In granting such application the court shall issue a commission for the purpose of taking the testimony sought by the applicant addressed to any consular officer of the United States conveniently located for the purpose. In cases of testimony taken on oral or partly oral interrogatories, the court shall make provisions in the commission for the selection as hereinafter provided of foreign counsel to represent each party (except the United States) to the criminal action or proceeding in which the foreign documents in question are to be used, unless such party has, prior to the issuance of the commission, notified the court that he does not desire the selection of foreign counsel to represent him at the time of taking of such testimony. In cases of testimony taken on written interrogatories, such provision shall be made only upon the request of any such party prior to the issuance of such commission. Selection of foreign counsel shall be made by the party whom such foreign counsel is to represent within ten days prior to the taking of testimony or by the court from which the commission issued, upon the request of such party made within such time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Any consular officer to whom a commission is addressed to take testimony, who is interested in the outcome of the criminal action or proceeding in which the foreign documents in question are to be used or has participated in the prosecution of such action or proceeding, whether by investigations, preparation of evidence, or otherwise, may be disqualified on his own motion or on that of the United States or any other party to such criminal action or proceeding made to the court from which the commission issued at any time prior to the execution thereof. If after notice and hearing, the court grants the motion, it shall instruct the consular officer thus disqualified to send the commission to any other consular officer of the United States named by the court, and such other officer shall execute the commission according to its terms and shall for all purposes be deemed the officer to whom the commission is addressed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The provisions of this section and sections 3493&ndash;3496 of this title applicable to consular officers shall be applicable to diplomatic officers pursuant to such regulations as may be prescribed by the President.

<p class="statutory-body">(a) In any criminal prosecution brought by the United States, no statement or report in the possession of the United States which was made by a Government witness or prospective Government witness (other than the defendant) shall be the subject of subpena, discovery, or inspection until said witness has testified on direct examination in the trial of the case.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) After a witness called by the United States has testified on direct examination, the court shall, on motion of the defendant, order the United States to produce any statement (as hereinafter defined) of the witness in the possession of the United States which relates to the subject matter as to which the witness has testified. If the entire contents of any such statement relate to the subject matter of the testimony of the witness, the court shall order it to be delivered directly to the defendant for his examination and use.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) If the United States claims that any statement ordered to be produced under this section contains matter which does not relate to the subject matter of the testimony of the witness, the court shall order the United States to deliver such statement for the inspection of the court in camera. Upon such delivery the court shall excise the portions of such statement which do not relate to the subject matter of the testimony of the witness. With such material excised, the court shall then direct delivery of such statement to the defendant for his use. If, pursuant to such procedure, any portion of such statement is withheld from the defendant and the defendant objects to such withholding, and the trial is continued to an adjudication of the guilt of the defendant, the entire text of such statement shall be preserved by the United States and, in the event the defendant appeals, shall be made available to the appellate court for the purpose of determining the correctness of the ruling of the trial judge. Whenever any statement is delivered to a defendant pursuant to this section, the court in its discretion, upon application of said defendant, may recess proceedings in the trial for such time as it may determine to be reasonably required for the examination of such statement by said defendant and his preparation for its use in the trial.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) If the United States elects not to comply with an order of the court under subsection (b) or (c) hereof to deliver to the defendant any such statement, or such portion thereof as the court may direct, the court shall strike from the record the testimony of the witness, and the trial shall proceed unless the court in its discretion shall determine that the interests of justice require that a mistrial be declared.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) The term &quot;statement&quot;, as used in subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section in relation to any witness called by the United States, means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a written statement made by said witness and signed or otherwise adopted or approved by him;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) In any criminal prosecution brought by the United States or by the District of Columbia, a confession, as defined in subsection (e) hereof, shall be admissible in evidence if it is voluntarily given. Before such confession is received in evidence, the trial judge shall, out of the presence of the jury, determine any issue as to voluntariness. If the trial judge determines that the confession was voluntarily made it shall be admitted in evidence and the trial judge shall permit the jury to hear relevant evidence on the issue of voluntariness and shall instruct the jury to give such weight to the confession as the jury feels it deserves under all the circumstances.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The trial judge in determining the issue of voluntariness shall take into consideration all the circumstances surrounding the giving of the confession, including (1) the time elapsing between arrest and arraignment of the defendant making the confession, if it was made after arrest and before arraignment, (2) whether such defendant knew the nature of the offense with which he was charged or of which he was suspected at the time of making the confession, (3) whether or not such defendant was advised or knew that he was not required to make any statement and that any such statement could be used against him, (4) whether or not such defendant had been advised prior to questioning of his right to the assistance of counsel; and (5) whether or not such defendant was without the assistance of counsel when questioned and when giving such confession.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The presence or absence of any of the above-mentioned factors to be taken into consideration by the judge need not be conclusive on the issue of voluntariness of the confession.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) In any criminal prosecution by the United States or by the District of Columbia, a confession made or given by a person who is a defendant therein, while such person was under arrest or other detention in the custody of any law-enforcement officer or law-enforcement agency, shall not be inadmissible solely because of delay in bringing such person before a magistrate judge or other officer empowered to commit persons charged with offenses against the laws of the United States or of the District of Columbia if such confession is found by the trial judge to have been made voluntarily and if the weight to be given the confession is left to the jury and if such confession was made or given by such person within six hours immediately following his arrest or other detention: <i>Provided</i>, That the time limitation contained in this subsection shall not apply in any case in which the delay in bringing such person before such magistrate judge or other officer beyond such six-hour period is found by the trial judge to be reasonable considering the means of transportation and the distance to be traveled to the nearest available such magistrate judge or other officer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Nothing contained in this section shall bar the admission in evidence of any confession made or given voluntarily by any person to any other person without interrogation by anyone, or at any time at which the person who made or gave such confession was not under arrest or other detention.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) As used in this section, the term &quot;confession&quot; means any confession of guilt of any criminal offense or any self-incriminating statement made or given orally or in writing.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The court may order that the testimony of the child be taken by closed-circuit television as provided in subparagraph (A) if the court finds that the child is unable to testify in open court in the presence of the defendant, for any of the following reasons:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The child's testimony shall be transmitted by closed circuit television into the courtroom for viewing and hearing by the defendant, jury, judge, and public.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) The trial judge shall preside at the videotape deposition of a child and shall rule on all questions as if at trial. The only other persons who may be permitted to be present at the proceeding are&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) the attorney for the Government;</p>

If the court orders that the defendant be excluded from the deposition room, the court shall order that 2-way closed circuit television equipment relay the defendant's image into the room in which the child is testifying, and the child's testimony into the room in which the defendant is viewing the proceeding, and that the defendant be provided with a means of private, contemporaneous communication with the defendant's attorney during the deposition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) <cap-smallcap>Handling of videotape</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The complete record of the examination of the child, including the image and voices of all persons who in any way participate in the examination, shall be made and preserved on video tape in addition to being stenographically recorded. The videotape shall be transmitted to the clerk of the court in which the action is pending and shall be made available for viewing to the prosecuting attorney, the defendant, and the defendant's attorney during ordinary business hours.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) If at the time of trial the court finds that the child is unable to testify as for a reason described in subparagraph (B)(i), the court may admit into evidence the child's videotaped deposition in lieu of the child's testifying at the trial. The court shall support a ruling under this subparagraph with findings on the record.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) Upon timely receipt of notice that new evidence has been discovered after the original videotaping and before or during trial, the court, for good cause shown, may order an additional videotaped deposition. The testimony of the child shall be restricted to the matters specified by the court as the basis for granting the order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) In connection with the taking of a videotaped deposition under this paragraph, the court may enter a protective order for the purpose of protecting the privacy of the child.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) The videotape of a deposition taken under this paragraph shall be destroyed 5 years after the date on which the trial court entered its judgment, but not before a final judgment is entered on appeal including Supreme Court review. The videotape shall become part of the court record and be kept by the court until it is destroyed.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Guardian Ad Litem.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The court may appoint, and provide reasonable compensation and payment of expenses for, a guardian ad litem for a child who was a victim of, or a witness to, a crime involving abuse or exploitation to protect the best interests of the child. In making the appointment, the court shall consider a prospective guardian's background in, and familiarity with, the judicial process, social service programs, and child abuse issues. The guardian ad litem shall not be a person who is or may be a witness in a proceeding involving the child for whom the guardian is appointed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Duties of guardian ad litem</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A guardian ad litem may attend all the depositions, hearings, and trial proceedings in which a child participates, and make recommendations to the court concerning the welfare of the child.

The image of the child attendant, for the time the child is testifying or being deposed, shall be recorded on videotape.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j) <cap-smallcap>Speedy Trial</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In a proceeding in which a child is called to give testimony, on motion by the attorney for the Government or a guardian ad litem, or on its own motion, the court may designate the case as being of special public importance. In cases so designated, the court shall, consistent with these rules, expedite the proceeding and ensure that it takes precedence over any other. The court shall ensure a speedy trial in order to minimize the length of time the child must endure the stress of involvement with the criminal process. When deciding whether to grant a continuance, the court shall take into consideration the age of the child and the potential adverse impact the delay may have on the child's well-being. The court shall make written findings of fact and conclusions of law when granting a continuance in cases involving a child.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(k) <cap-smallcap>Stay of Civil Action</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If, at any time that a cause of action for recovery of compensation for damage or injury to the person of a child exists, a criminal action is pending which arises out of the same occurrence and in which the child is the victim, the civil action shall be stayed until the end of all phases of the criminal action and any mention of the civil action during the criminal proceeding is prohibited.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2)(A) Notwithstanding Rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, a court shall deny, in any criminal proceeding, any request by the defendant to copy, photograph, duplicate, or otherwise reproduce any property or material that constitutes child pornography (as defined by section 2256 of this title), so long as the Government makes the property or material reasonably available to the defendant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) For the purposes of subparagraph (A), property or material shall be deemed to be reasonably available to the defendant if the Government provides ample opportunity for inspection, viewing, and examination at a Government facility of the property or material by the defendant, his or her attorney, and any individual the defendant may seek to qualify to furnish expert testimony at trial.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;3521. Witness relocation and protection</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) The Attorney General may provide for the relocation and other protection of a witness or a potential witness for the Federal Government or for a State government in an official proceeding concerning an organized criminal activity or other serious offense, if the Attorney General determines that an offense involving a crime of violence directed at the witness with respect to that proceeding, an offense set forth in chapter 73 of this title directed at the witness, or a State offense that is similar in nature to either such offense, is likely to be committed. The Attorney General may also provide for the relocation and other protection of the immediate family of, or a person otherwise closely associated with, such witness or potential witness if the family or person may also be endangered on account of the participation of the witness in the judicial proceeding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Attorney General shall issue guidelines defining the types of cases for which the exercise of the authority of the Attorney General contained in paragraph (1) would be appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The United States and its officers and employees shall not be subject to any civil liability on account of any decision to provide or not to provide protection under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) In connection with the protection under this chapter of a witness, a potential witness, or an immediate family member or close associate of a witness or potential witness, the Attorney General shall take such action as the Attorney General determines to be necessary to protect the person involved from bodily injury and otherwise to assure the health, safety, and welfare of that person, including the psychological well-being and social adjustment of that person, for as long as, in the judgment of the Attorney General, the danger to that person exists. The Attorney General may, by regulation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) provide suitable documents to enable the person to establish a new identity or otherwise protect the person;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) provide housing for the person;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) provide for the transportation of household furniture and other personal property to a new residence of the person;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) provide to the person a payment to meet basic living expenses, in a sum established in accordance with regulations issued by the Attorney General, for such times as the Attorney General determines to be warranted;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) assist the person in obtaining employment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) provide other services necessary to assist the person in becoming self-sustaining;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) disclose or refuse to disclose the identity or location of the person relocated or protected, or any other matter concerning the person or the program after weighing the danger such a disclosure would pose to the person, the detriment it would cause to the general effectiveness of the program, and the benefit it would afford to the public or to the person seeking the disclosure, except that the Attorney General shall, upon the request of State or local law enforcement officials or pursuant to a court order, without undue delay, disclose to such officials the identity, location, criminal records, and fingerprints relating to the person relocated or protected when the Attorney General knows or the request indicates that the person is under investigation for or has been arrested for or charged with an offense that is punishable by more than one year in prison or that is a crime of violence;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(H) protect the confidentiality of the identity and location of persons subject to registration requirements as convicted offenders under Federal or State law, including prescribing alternative procedures to those otherwise provided by Federal or State law for registration and tracking of such persons; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) exempt procurement for services, materials, and supplies, and the renovation and construction of safe sites within existing buildings from other provisions of law as may be required to maintain the security of protective witnesses and the integrity of the Witness Security Program.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Attorney General shall establish an accurate, efficient, and effective system of records concerning the criminal history of persons provided protection under this chapter in order to provide the information described in subparagraph (G).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Deductions shall be made from any payment made to a person pursuant to paragraph (1)(D) to satisfy obligations of that person for family support payments pursuant to a State court order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any person who, without the authorization of the Attorney General, knowingly discloses any information received from the Attorney General under paragraph (1)(G) shall be fined $5,000 or imprisoned five years, or both.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Before providing protection to any person under this chapter, the Attorney General shall, to the extent practicable, obtain information relating to the suitability of the person for inclusion in the program, including the criminal his<!-- PDFPage:782 -->tory, if any, and a psychological evaluation of, the person. The Attorney General shall also make a written assessment in each case of the seriousness of the investigation or case in which the person's information or testimony has been or will be provided and the possible risk of danger to other persons and property in the community where the person is to be relocated and shall determine whether the need for that person's testimony outweighs the risk of danger to the public. In assessing whether a person should be provided protection under this chapter, the Attorney General shall consider the person's criminal record, alternatives to providing protection under this chapter, the possibility of securing similar testimony from other sources, the need for protecting the person, the relative importance of the person's testimony, results of psychological examinations, whether providing such protection will substantially infringe upon the relationship between a child who would be relocated in connection with such protection and that child's parent who would not be so relocated, and such other factors as the Attorney General considers appropriate. The Attorney General shall not provide protection to any person under this chapter if the risk of danger to the public, including the potential harm to innocent victims, outweighs the need for that person's testimony. This subsection shall not be construed to authorize the disclosure of the written assessment made pursuant to this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) Before providing protection to any person under this chapter, the Attorney General shall enter into a memorandum of understanding with that person. Each such memorandum of understanding shall set forth the responsibilities of that person, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the agreement of the person, if a witness or potential witness, to testify in and provide information to all appropriate law enforcement officials concerning all appropriate proceedings;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the agreement of the person not to commit any crime;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the agreement of the person to take all necessary steps to avoid detection by others of the facts concerning the protection provided to that person under this chapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the agreement of the person to comply with legal obligations and civil judgments against that person;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) the agreement of the person to cooperate with all reasonable requests of officers and employees of the Government who are providing protection under this chapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) the agreement of the person to designate another person to act as agent for the service of process;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) the agreement of the person to make a sworn statement of all outstanding legal obligations, including obligations concerning child custody and visitation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(H) the agreement of the person to disclose any probation or parole responsibilities, and if the person is on probation or parole under State law, to consent to Federal supervision in accordance with section 3522 of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) the agreement of the person to regularly inform the appropriate program official of the activities and current address of such person.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Each such memorandum of understanding shall also set forth the protection which the Attorney General has determined will be provided to the person under this chapter, and the procedures to be followed in the case of a breach of the memorandum of understanding, as such procedures are established by the Attorney General. Such procedures shall include a procedure for filing and resolution of grievances of persons provided protection under this chapter regarding the administration of the program. This procedure shall include the opportunity for resolution of a grievance by a person who was not involved in the case.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Attorney General shall enter into a separate memorandum of understanding pursuant to this subsection with each person protected under this chapter who is eighteen years of age or older. The memorandum of understanding shall be signed by the Attorney General and the person protected.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Attorney General may delegate the responsibility initially to authorize protection under this chapter only to the Deputy Attorney General, to the Associate Attorney General, to any Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Criminal Division or National Security Division of the Department of Justice, to the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice (insofar as the delegation relates to a criminal civil rights case), and to one other officer or employee of the Department of Justice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) If the Attorney General determines that harm to a person for whom protection may be provided under section 3521 of this title is imminent or that failure to provide immediate protection would otherwise seriously jeopardize an ongoing investigation, the Attorney General may provide temporary protection to such person under this chapter before making the written assessment and determination required by subsection (c) of this section or entering into the memorandum of understanding required by subsection (d) of this section. In such a case the Attorney General shall make such assessment and determination and enter into such memorandum of understanding without undue delay after the protection is initiated.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) The Attorney General may terminate the protection provided under this chapter to any person who substantially breaches the memorandum of understanding entered into between the Attorney General and that person pursuant to subsection (d), or who provides false information concerning the memorandum of understanding or the circumstances pursuant to which the person was provided protection under this chapter, including information with respect to the nature and circumstances concerning child custody and visitation. Before terminating such protection, the Attorney General shall send notice to the person involved of the termination of the protection provided under this chapter and the reasons for the termination. The decision of the Attorney General to terminate such protection shall not be subject to judicial review.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) A probation officer may, upon the request of the Attorney General, supervise any person provided protection under this chapter who is on probation or parole under State law, if the State involved consents to such supervision.

<p class="statutory-body">(c) The United States Parole Commission and the Chairman of the Commission shall have the same powers and duties with respect to a probationer or parolee transferred from State supervision pursuant to this section as they have with respect to an offender convicted in a court of the United States and paroled under chapter 311&#160;<sup><a href="#3522_1_target" name="3522_1">1</a></sup> of this title.

Proceedings to collect the moneys ordered to be paid may be instituted by the Attorney General in any United States district court.

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) If a person provided protection under this chapter is named as a defendant in a civil cause of action arising prior to or during the period in which the protection is provided, process in the civil proceeding may be served upon that person or an agent designated by that person for that purpose. The Attorney General shall make reasonable efforts to serve a copy of the process <!-- PDFPage:784 -->upon the person protected at the person's last known address. The Attorney General shall notify the plaintiff in the action whether such process has been served. If a judgment in such action is entered against that person the Attorney General shall determine whether the person has made reasonable efforts to comply with the judgment. The Attorney General shall take appropriate steps to urge the person to comply with the judgment. If the Attorney General determines that the person has not made reasonable efforts to comply with the judgment, the Attorney General may, after considering the danger to the person and upon the request of the person holding the judgment disclose the identity and location of the person to the plaintiff entitled to recovery pursuant to the judgment. Any such disclosure of the identity and location of the person shall be made upon the express condition that further disclosure by the plaintiff of such identity or location may be made only if essential to the plaintiff's efforts to recover under the judgment, and only to such additional persons as is necessary to effect the recovery. Any such disclosure or nondisclosure by the Attorney General shall not subject the United States and its officers or employees to any civil liability.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) Any person who holds a judgment entered by a Federal or State court in his or her favor against a person provided protection under this chapter may, upon a decision by the Attorney General to deny disclosure of the current identity and location of such protected person, bring an action against the protected person in the United States district court in the district where the person holding the judgment (hereinafter in this subsection referred to as the &quot;petitioner&quot;) resides. Such action shall be brought within one hundred and twenty days after the petitioner requested the Attorney General to disclose the identity and location of the protected person. The complaint in such action shall contain statements that the petitioner holds a valid judgment of a Federal or State court against a person provided protection under this chapter and that the petitioner sought to enforce the judgment by requesting the Attorney General to disclose the identity and location of the protected person.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The petitioner in an action described in paragraph (1) shall notify the Attorney General of the action at the same time the action is brought. The Attorney General shall appear in the action and shall affirm or deny the statements in the complaint that the person against whom the judgment is allegedly held is provided protection under this chapter and that the petitioner requested the Attorney General to disclose the identity and location of the protected person for the purpose of enforcing the judgment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Upon a determination (A) that the petitioner holds a judgment entered by a Federal or State court and (B) that the Attorney General has declined to disclose to the petitioner the current identity and location of the protected person against whom the judgment was entered, the court shall appoint a guardian to act on behalf of the petitioner to enforce the judgment. The clerk of the court shall forthwith furnish the guardian with a copy of the order of appointment. The Attorney General shall disclose to the guardian the current identity and location of the protected person and any other information necessary to enable the guardian to carry out his or her duties under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) It is the duty of the guardian to proceed with all reasonable diligence and dispatch to enforce the rights of the petitioner under the judgment. The guardian shall, however, endeavor to carry out such enforcement duties in a manner that maximizes, to the extent practicable, the safety and security of the protected person. In no event shall the guardian disclose the new identity or location of the protected person without the permission of the Attorney General, except that such disclosure may be made to a Federal or State court in order to enforce the judgment. Any good faith disclosure made by the guardian in the performance of his or her duties under this subsection shall not create any civil liability against the United States or any of its officers or employees.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Upon appointment, the guardian shall have the power to perform any act with respect to the judgment which the petitioner could perform, including the initiation of judicial enforcement actions in any Federal or State court or the assignment of such enforcement actions to a third party under applicable Federal or State law. The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure shall apply in any action brought under this subsection to enforce a Federal or State court judgment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) The costs of any action brought under this subsection with respect to a judgment, including any enforcement action described in paragraph (5), and the compensation to be allowed to a guardian appointed in any such action shall be fixed by the court and shall be apportioned among the parties as follows: the petitioner shall be assessed in the amount the petitioner would have paid to collect on the judgment in an action not arising under the provisions of this subsection; the protected person shall be assessed the costs which are normally charged to debtors in similar actions and any other costs which are incurred as a result of an action brought under this subsection. In the event that the costs and compensation to the guardian are not met by the petitioner or by the protected person, the court may, in its discretion, enter judgment against the United States for costs and fees reasonably incurred as a result of the action brought under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) No officer or employee of the Department of Justice shall in any way impede the efforts of a guardian appointed under this subsection to enforce the judgment with respect to which the guardian was appointed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The provisions of this section shall not apply to a court order to which section 3524 of this title applies.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;3524. Child custody arrangements</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Attorney General may not relocate any child in connection with protection provided to a person under this chapter if it appears that a person other than that protected person has legal custody of that child.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Before protection is provided under this chapter to any person (1) who is a parent of a child of whom that person has custody, and (2) who has obligations to another parent of that child with respect to custody or visitation of that child under a court order, the Attorney General shall obtain and examine a copy of such order for the purpose of assuring that compliance with the order can be achieved. If compliance with a visitation order cannot be achieved, the Attorney General may provide protection under this chapter to the person only if the parent being relocated initiates legal action to modify the existing court order under subsection (e)(1) of this section. The parent being relocated must agree in writing before being provided protection to abide by any ensuing court orders issued as a result of an action to modify.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) With respect to any person provided protection under this chapter (1) who is the parent of a child who is relocated in connection with such protection and (2) who has obligations to another parent of that child with respect to custody or visitation of that child under a State court order, the Attorney General shall, as soon as practicable after the person and child are so relocated, notify in writing the child's parent who is not so relocated that the child has been provided protection under this chapter. The notification shall also include statements that the rights of the parent not so relocated to visitation or custody, or both, under the court order shall not be infringed by the relocation of the child and the Department of Justice responsibility with respect thereto. The Department of Justice will pay all reasonable costs of transportation and security incurred in insuring that visitation can occur at a secure location as designated by the United States Marshals Service, but in no event shall it be obligated to pay such costs for visitation in excess of thirty days a year, or twelve in number a year. Additional visitation may be paid for, in the discretion of the Attorney General, by the Department of Justice in extraordinary circumstances. In the event that the unrelocated parent pays visitation costs, the Department of Justice may, in the discretion of the Attorney General, extend security arrangements associated with such visitation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) With respect to any person provided protection under this chapter (A) who is the parent of a child who is relocated in connection with such protection and (B) who has obligations to another parent of that child with respect to custody or visitation of that child under a court order, an action to modify that court order may be brought by any party to the court order in the District Court for the District of Columbia or in the district court for the district in which the child's parent resides who has not been relocated in connection with such protection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) With respect to actions brought under paragraph (1), the district courts shall establish a procedure to provide a reasonable opportunity for the parties to the court order to mediate their dispute with respect to the order. The court shall provide a mediator for this purpose. If the dispute is mediated, the court shall issue an order in accordance with the resolution of the dispute.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If, within sixty days after an action is brought under paragraph (1) to modify a court order, the dispute has not been mediated, any party to the court order may request arbitration of the dispute. In the case of such a request, the court shall appoint a master to act as arbitrator, who shall be experienced in domestic relations matters. Rule 53 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure shall apply to masters appointed under this paragraph. The court and the master shall, in determining the dispute, give substantial deference to the need for maintaining parent-child relationships, and any order issued by the court shall be in the best interests of the child. In actions to modify a court order brought under this subsection, the court and the master shall apply the law of the State in which the court order was issued or, in the case of the modification of a court order issued by a district court under this section, the law of the State in which the parent resides who was not relocated in connection with the protection provided under this chapter. The costs to the Government of carrying out a court order may be considered in an action brought under this subsection to modify that court order but shall not outweigh the relative interests of the parties themselves and the child.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Until a court order is modified under this subsection, all parties to that court order shall comply with their obligations under that court order subject to the limitations set forth in subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) With respect to any person provided protection under this chapter who is the parent of a child who is relocated in connection with such protection, the parent not relocated in connection with such protection may bring an action, in the District Court for the District of Columbia or in the district court for the district in which that parent resides, for violation by that protected person of a court order with respect to custody or visitation of that child. If the court finds that such a violation has occurred, the court may hold in contempt the protected person. Once held in contempt, the protected person shall have a maximum of sixty days, in the discretion of the Attorney General, to comply with the court order. If the protected person fails to comply with the order within the time specified by the Attorney General, the Attorney General shall disclose the new identity and address of the protected person to the other parent and terminate any financial assistance to the protected person unless otherwise directed by the court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) The United States shall be required by the court to pay litigation costs, including reason<!-- PDFPage:786 -->able attorneys&apos; fees, incurred by a parent who prevails in enforcing a custody or visitation order; but shall retain the right to recover such costs from the protected person.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) In any case in which the Attorney General determines that, as a result of the relocation of a person and a child of whom that person is a parent in connection with protection provided under this chapter, the implementation of a court order with respect to custody or visitation of that child would be substantially impossible, the Attorney General may bring, on behalf of the person provided protection under this chapter, an action to modify the court order. Such action may be brought in the district court for the district in which the parent resides who would not be or was not relocated in connection with the protection provided under this chapter. In an action brought under this paragraph, if the Attorney General establishes, by clear and convincing evidence, that implementation of the court order involved would be substantially impossible, the court may modify the court order but shall, subject to appropriate security considerations, provide an alternative as substantially equivalent to the original rights of the nonrelocating parent as feasible under the circumstances.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) With respect to any State court order in effect to which this section applies, and with respect to any district court order in effect which is issued under this section, if the parent who is not relocated in connection with protection provided under this chapter intentionally violates a reasonable security requirement imposed by the Attorney General with respect to the implementation of that court order, the Attorney General may bring an action in the district court for the district in which that parent resides to modify the court order. The court may modify the court order if the court finds such an intentional violation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The procedures for mediation and arbitration provided under subsection (d) of this section shall not apply to actions for modification brought under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) In any case in which a person provided protection under this chapter is the parent of a child of whom that person has custody and has obligations to another parent of that child concerning custody and visitation of that child which are not imposed by court order, that person, or the parent not relocated in connection with such protection, may bring an action in the district court of the district in which that parent not relocated resides to obtain an order providing for custody or visitation, or both, of that child. In any such action, all the provisions of subsection (d) of this section shall apply.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) In any case in which an action under this section involves court orders from different States with respect to custody or visitation of the same child, the court shall resolve any conflicts by applying the rules of conflict of laws of the State in which the court is sitting.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h)(1) Subject to paragraph (2), the costs of any action described in subsection (d), (e), or (f) of this section shall be paid by the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Attorney General shall insure that any State court order in effect to which this section applies and any district court order in effect which is issued under this section are carried out. The Department of Justice shall pay all costs and fees described in subsections (c) and (d) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) As used in this section, the term &quot;parent&quot; includes any person who stands in the place of a parent by law.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Presentence Investigation and Report by Probation Officer</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A United States probation officer shall make a presentence investigation of a defendant that is required pursuant to the provisions of Rule 32(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, and shall, before the imposition of sentence, report the results of the investigation to the court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Presentence Study and Report by Bureau of Prisons</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the court, before or after its receipt of a report specified in subsection (a) or (c), desires more information than is otherwise available to it as a basis for determining the sentence to be imposed on a defendant found guilty of a misdemeanor or felony, it may order a study of the defendant. The study shall be conducted in the local community by qualified consultants unless the sentencing judge finds that there is a compelling reason for the study to be done by the Bureau of Prisons or there are no adequate professional resources available in the local community to perform the study. The period of the study shall be no more than sixty days. The order shall specify the additional information that the court needs before determining the sentence to be imposed. Such an order shall be treated for administrative purposes as a provisional sentence of imprisonment for the maximum term authorized by section 3581(b) for the offense committed. The study shall inquire into such matters as are specified by the court and any other matters that the Bureau of Prisons or the professional consultants believe are pertinent to the factors set forth in section 3553(a). The period of the study may, in the discretion of the court, be extended for an additional period of not more than sixty days. By the expiration of the period of the study, or by the expiration of any extension granted by the court, the United States marshal shall, if the defendant is in custody, return the defendant to the court for final sentencing. The Bureau of Prisons or the professional consultants shall provide the court with a written report of the pertinent results of the study and make to the court whatever recommendations the Bureau or the consultants believe will be helpful to a proper resolution of the case. The report shall include recommendations of the Bureau or the consultants concerning the guidelines and policy statements, promulgated by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 994(a), that they believe are applicable to the defendant's case. After receiving the report and the recommendations, the court shall proceed finally to sentence the defendant in accordance with the sentencing alternatives and procedures available under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Presentence Examination and Report by Psychiatric or Psychological Examiners</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the court, before or after its receipt of a report specified in subsection (a) or (b) desires more information than is otherwise available to it as a basis for determining the mental condition of the defendant, the court may order the same psychiatric or psychological examination and report thereon as may be ordered under section 4244(b) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Disclosure of Presentence Reports</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The court shall assure that a report filed pursuant to this section is disclosed to the defendant, the counsel for the defendant, and the attorney for the Government at least ten days prior to the date set for sentencing, unless this minimum period is waived by the defendant. The court shall provide a copy of the presentence report to the attorney for the Government to use in collecting an assessment, criminal fine, forfeiture or restitution imposed.</p>

In the absence of an applicable sentencing guideline, the court shall impose an appropriate sentence, having due regard for the purposes set forth in subsection (a)(2).

<p class="statutory-body-block">a judgment that includes such a sentence is a final judgment for all other purposes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Time, Method of Payment, and Related Items</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A person sentenced to pay a fine or other monetary penalty, including restitution, shall make such payment immediately, unless, in the interest of justice, the court provides for payment on a date certain or in installments. If the court provides for payment in installments, the installments shall be in equal monthly payments over the period provided by the court, unless the court establishes another schedule.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the judgment, or, in the case of a restitution order, the order, permits other than immediate payment, the length of time over which scheduled payments will be made shall be set by the court, but shall be the shortest time in which full payment can reasonably be made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A judgment for a fine which permits payments in installments shall include a requirement that the defendant will notify the court of any material change in the defendant's economic circumstances that might affect the defendant's ability to pay the fine. Upon receipt of such notice the court may, on its own motion or the motion of any party, adjust the payment schedule, or require immediate payment in full, as the interests of justice require.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Alternative Sentence Precluded</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;At the time a defendant is sentenced to pay a fine, the court may not impose an alternative sentence to be carried out if the fine is not paid.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Responsibility for Payment of Monetary Obligation Relating to Organization</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If a sentence includes a fine, special assessment, restitution or other monetary obligation (including <!-- PDFPage:808 -->interest) with respect to an organization, each individual authorized to make disbursements for the organization has a duty to pay the obligation from assets of the organization. If such an obligation is imposed on a director, officer, shareholder, employee, or agent of an organization, payments may not be made, directly or indirectly, from assets of the organization, unless the court finds that such payment is expressly permissible under applicable State law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Security for Stayed Fine</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If a sentence imposing a fine is stayed, the court shall, absent exceptional circumstances (as determined by the court)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) require the defendant to deposit, in the registry of the district court, any amount of the fine that is due;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) require the defendant to provide a bond or other security to ensure payment of the fine; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) restrain the defendant from transferring or dissipating assets.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Delinquency</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A fine or payment of restitution is delinquent if a payment is more than 30 days late.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) <cap-smallcap>Default</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A fine or payment of restitution is in default if a payment is delinquent for more than 90 days. Notwithstanding any installment schedule, when a fine or payment of restitution is in default, the entire amount of the fine or restitution is due within 30 days after notification of the default, subject to the provisions of section 3613A.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;3583. Inclusion of a term of supervised release after imprisonment</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>In General</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The court, in imposing a sentence to a term of imprisonment for a felony or a misdemeanor, may include as a part of the sentence a requirement that the defendant be placed on a term of supervised release after imprisonment, except that the court shall include as a part of the sentence a requirement that the defendant be placed on a term of supervised release if such a term is required by statute or if the defendant has been convicted for the first time of a domestic violence crime as defined in section 3561(b).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Authorized Terms of Supervised Release</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except as otherwise provided, the authorized terms of supervised release are&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) for a Class A or Class B felony, not more than five years;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) for a Class C or Class D felony, not more than three years; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) for a Class E felony, or for a misdemeanor (other than a petty offense), not more than one year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Factors To Be Considered in Including a Term of Supervised Release</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The court, in determining whether to include a term of supervised release, and, if a term of supervised release is to be included, in determining the length of the term and the conditions of supervised release, shall consider the factors set forth in section 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), and (a)(7).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Conditions of Supervised Release</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The court shall order, as an explicit condition of su<!-- PDFPage:812 -->pervised release, that the defendant not commit another Federal, State, or local crime during the term of supervision, that the defendant make restitution in accordance with sections 3663 and 3663A, or any other statute authorizing a sentence of restitution, and that the defendant not unlawfully possess a controlled substance. The court shall order as an explicit condition of supervised release for a defendant convicted for the first time of a domestic violence crime as defined in section 3561(b) that the defendant attend a public, private, or private nonprofit offender rehabilitation program that has been approved by the court, in consultation with a State Coalition Against Domestic Violence or other appropriate experts, if an approved program is readily available within a 50-mile radius of the legal residence of the defendant. The court shall order, as an explicit condition of supervised release for a person required to register under the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act, that the person comply with the requirements of that Act. The court shall order, as an explicit condition of supervised release, that the defendant cooperate in the collection of a DNA sample from the defendant, if the collection of such a sample is authorized pursuant to section 3 of the DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act of 2000. The court shall also order, as an explicit condition of supervised release, that the defendant refrain from any unlawful use of a controlled substance and submit to a drug test within 15 days of release on supervised release and at least 2 periodic drug tests thereafter (as determined by the court) for use of a controlled substance. The condition stated in the preceding sentence may be ameliorated or suspended by the court as provided in section 3563(a)(4).<sup><a href="#3583_1_target" name="3583_1">1</a></sup> The results of a drug test administered in accordance with the preceding subsection shall be subject to confirmation only if the results are positive, the defendant is subject to possible imprisonment for such failure, and either the defendant denies the accuracy of such test or there is some other reason to question the results of the test. A drug test confirmation shall be a urine drug test confirmed using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry techniques or such test as the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts after consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services may determine to be of equivalent accuracy. The court shall consider whether the availability of appropriate substance abuse treatment programs, or an individual's current or past participation in such programs, warrants an exception in accordance with United States Sentencing Commission guidelines from the rule of section 3583(g) when considering any action against a defendant who fails a drug test. The court may order, as a further condition of supervised release, to the extent that such condition&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) is reasonably related to the factors set forth in section 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), and (a)(2)(D);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) involves no greater deprivation of liberty than is reasonably necessary for the purposes set forth in section 3553(a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), and (a)(2)(D); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) is consistent with any pertinent policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 994(a);</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">any condition set forth as a discretionary condition of probation in section 3563(b) and any other condition it considers to be appropriate, provided, however that a condition set forth in subsection 3563(b)(10) shall be imposed only for a violation of a condition of supervised release in accordance with section 3583(e)(2) and only when facilities are available. If an alien defendant is subject to deportation, the court may provide, as a condition of supervised release, that he be deported and remain outside the United States, and may order that he be delivered to a duly authorized immigration official for such deportation. The court may order, as an explicit condition of supervised release for a person who is a felon and required to register under the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act, that the person submit his person, and any property, house, residence, vehicle, papers, computer, other electronic communications or data storage devices or media, and effects to search at any time, with or without a warrant, by any law enforcement or probation officer with reasonable suspicion concerning a violation of a condition of supervised release or unlawful conduct by the person, and by any probation officer in the lawful discharge of the officer's supervision functions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Modification of Conditions or Revocation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The court may, after considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), and (a)(7)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) terminate a term of supervised release and discharge the defendant released at any time after the expiration of one year of supervised release, pursuant to the provisions of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure relating to the modification of probation, if it is satisfied that such action is warranted by the conduct of the defendant released and the interest of justice;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) extend a term of supervised release if less than the maximum authorized term was previously imposed, and may modify, reduce, or enlarge the conditions of supervised release, at any time prior to the expiration or termination of the term of supervised release, pursuant to the provisions of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure relating to the modification of probation and the provisions applicable to the initial setting of the terms and conditions of post-release supervision;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) revoke a term of supervised release, and require the defendant to serve in prison all or part of the term of supervised release authorized by statute for the offense that resulted in such term of supervised release without credit for time previously served on postrelease supervision, if the court, pursuant to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure applicable to revocation of probation or supervised release, finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant violated a condition of supervised release, except that a defendant whose term is revoked under this paragraph may not be required to serve on any such revocation more than 5 years in prison if the offense that resulted in the term of supervised release is a <!-- PDFPage:813 -->class A felony, more than 3 years in prison if such offense is a class B felony, more than 2 years in prison if such offense is a class C or D felony, or more than one year in any other case; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) order the defendant to remain at his place of residence during nonworking hours and, if the court so directs, to have compliance monitored by telephone or electronic signaling devices, except that an order under this paragraph may be imposed only as an alternative to incarceration.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Written Statement of Conditions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The court shall direct that the probation officer provide the defendant with a written statement that sets forth all the conditions to which the term of supervised release is subject, and that is sufficiently clear and specific to serve as a guide for the defendant's conduct and for such supervision as is required.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Mandatory Revocation for Possession of Controlled Substance or Firearm or for Refusal To Comply With Drug Testing</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the defendant&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) possesses a controlled substance in violation of the condition set forth in subsection (d);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) possesses a firearm, as such term is defined in section 921 of this title, in violation of Federal law, or otherwise violates a condition of supervised release prohibiting the defendant from possessing a firearm;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) refuses to comply with drug testing imposed as a condition of supervised release; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) as a part of drug testing, tests positive for illegal controlled substances more than 3 times over the course of 1 year;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the court shall revoke the term of supervised release and require the defendant to serve a term of imprisonment not to exceed the maximum term of imprisonment authorized under subsection (e)(3).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Supervised Release Following Revocation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When a term of supervised release is revoked and the defendant is required to serve a term of imprisonment, the court may include a requirement that the defendant be placed on a term of supervised release after imprisonment. The length of such a term of supervised release shall not exceed the term of supervised release authorized by statute for the offense that resulted in the original term of supervised release, less any term of imprisonment that was imposed upon revocation of supervised release.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) <cap-smallcap>Delayed Revocation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The power of the court to revoke a term of supervised release for violation of a condition of supervised release, and to order the defendant to serve a term of imprisonment and, subject to the limitations in subsection (h), a further term of supervised release, extends beyond the expiration of the term of supervised release for any period reasonably necessary for the adjudication of matters arising before its expiration if, before its expiration, a warrant or summons has been issued on the basis of an allegation of such a violation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j) <cap-smallcap>Supervised Release Terms for Terrorism Predicates</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding subsection (b), the authorized term of supervised release for any offense listed in section 2332b(g)(5)(B) is any term of years or life.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(k) Notwithstanding subsection (b), the authorized term of supervised release for any offense under section 1201 involving a minor victim, and for any offense under section 1591, 1594(c), 2241, 2242, 2243, 2244, 2245, 2250, 2251, 2251A, 2252, 2252A, 2260, 2421, 2422, 2423, or 2425, is any term of years not less than 5, or life. If a defendant required to register under the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act commits any criminal offense under chapter 109A, 110, or 117, or section 1201 or 1591, for which imprisonment for a term longer than 1 year can be imposed, the court shall revoke the term of supervised release and require the defendant to serve a term of imprisonment under subsection (e)(3) without regard to the exception contained therein. Such term shall be not less than 5 years.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;3593. Special hearing to determine whether a sentence of death is justified</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Notice by the Government</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If, in a case involving an offense described in section 3591, the attorney for the government believes that the circumstances of the offense are such that a sentence of death is justified under this chapter, the attorney shall, a reasonable time before the trial or before acceptance by the court of a plea of guilty, sign and file with the court, and serve on the defendant, a notice&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) stating that the government believes that the circumstances of the offense are such that, if the defendant is convicted, a sentence of death is justified under this chapter and that the government will seek the sentence of death; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) setting forth the aggravating factor or factors that the government, if the defendant is convicted, proposes to prove as justifying a sentence of death.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The factors for which notice is provided under this subsection may include factors concerning <!-- PDFPage:820 -->the effect of the offense on the victim and the victim's family, and may include oral testimony, a victim impact statement that identifies the victim of the offense and the extent and scope of the injury and loss suffered by the victim and the victim's family, and any other relevant information. The court may permit the attorney for the government to amend the notice upon a showing of good cause.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Hearing Before a Court or Jury</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the attorney for the government has filed a notice as required under subsection (a) and the defendant is found guilty of or pleads guilty to an offense described in section 3591, the judge who presided at the trial or before whom the guilty plea was entered, or another judge if that judge is unavailable, shall conduct a separate sentencing hearing to determine the punishment to be imposed. The hearing shall be conducted&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) before the jury that determined the defendant's guilt;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) before a jury impaneled for the purpose of the hearing if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the defendant was convicted upon a plea of guilty;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the defendant was convicted after a trial before the court sitting without a jury;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the jury that determined the defendant's guilt was discharged for good cause; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) after initial imposition of a sentence under this section, reconsideration of the sentence under this section is necessary; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) before the court alone, upon the motion of the defendant and with the approval of the attorney for the government.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">A jury impaneled pursuant to paragraph (2) shall consist of 12 members, unless, at any time before the conclusion of the hearing, the parties stipulate, with the approval of the court, that it shall consist of a lesser number.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Proof of Mitigating and Aggravating Factors</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding rule 32 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, when a defendant is found guilty or pleads guilty to an offense under section 3591, no presentence report shall be prepared. At the sentencing hearing, information may be presented as to any matter relevant to the sentence, including any mitigating or aggravating factor permitted or required to be considered under section 3592. Information presented may include the trial transcript and exhibits if the hearing is held before a jury or judge not present during the trial, or at the trial judge's discretion. The defendant may present any information relevant to a mitigating factor. The government may present any information relevant to an aggravating factor for which notice has been provided under subsection (a). Information is admissible regardless of its admissibility under the rules governing admission of evidence at criminal trials except that information may be excluded if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of creating unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, or misleading the jury. For the purposes of the preceding sentence, the fact that a victim, as defined in section 3510, attended or observed the trial shall not be construed to pose a danger of creating unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, or misleading the jury. The government and the defendant shall be permitted to rebut any information received at the hearing, and shall be given fair opportunity to present argument as to the adequacy of the information to establish the existence of any aggravating or mitigating factor, and as to the appropriateness in the case of imposing a sentence of death. The government shall open the argument. The defendant shall be permitted to reply. The government shall then be permitted to reply in rebuttal. The burden of establishing the existence of any aggravating factor is on the government, and is not satisfied unless the existence of such a factor is established beyond a reasonable doubt. The burden of establishing the existence of any mitigating factor is on the defendant, and is not satisfied unless the existence of such a factor is established by a preponderance of the information.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Return of Special Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The jury, or if there is no jury, the court, shall consider all the information received during the hearing. It shall return special findings identifying any aggravating factor or factors set forth in section 3592 found to exist and any other aggravating factor for which notice has been provided under subsection (a) found to exist. A finding with respect to a mitigating factor may be made by 1 or more members of the jury, and any member of the jury who finds the existence of a mitigating factor may consider such factor established for purposes of this section regardless of the number of jurors who concur that the factor has been established. A finding with respect to any aggravating factor must be unanimous. If no aggravating factor set forth in section 3592 is found to exist, the court shall impose a sentence other than death authorized by law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Return of a Finding Concerning a Sentence of Death</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If, in the case of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) an offense described in section 3591(a)(1), an aggravating factor required to be considered under section 3592(b) is found to exist;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) an offense described in section 3591(a)(2), an aggravating factor required to be considered under section 3592(c) is found to exist; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) an offense described in section 3591(b), an aggravating factor required to be considered under section 3592(d) is found to exist,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the jury, or if there is no jury, the court, shall consider whether all the aggravating factor or factors found to exist sufficiently outweigh all the mitigating factor or factors found to exist to justify a sentence of death, or, in the absence of a mitigating factor, whether the aggravating factor or factors alone are sufficient to justify a sentence of death. Based upon this consideration, the jury by unanimous vote, or if there is no jury, the court, shall recommend whether the defendant should be sentenced to death, to life imprisonment without possibility of release or some other lesser sentence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Special Precaution To Ensure Against Discrimination</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In a hearing held before a jury, the court, prior to the return of a finding under subsection (e), shall instruct the jury that, in considering whether a sentence of death is justified, it shall not consider the race, color, religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim and that the jury is not to recommend a sentence of death unless it has concluded that it would recommend a sen<!-- PDFPage:821 -->tence of death for the crime in question no matter what the race, color, religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim may be. The jury, upon return of a finding under subsection (e), shall also return to the court a certificate, signed by each juror, that consideration of the race, color, religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant or any victim was not involved in reaching his or her individual decision and that the individual juror would have made the same recommendation regarding a sentence for the crime in question no matter what the race, color, religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant or any victim may be.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>In General</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Upon a written motion by an individual sentenced to imprisonment or death pursuant to a conviction for a Federal offense (referred to in this section as the &quot;applicant&quot;), the court that entered the judgment of conviction shall order DNA testing of specific evidence if the court finds that all of the following apply:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The applicant asserts, under penalty of perjury, that the applicant is actually innocent of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the Federal offense for which the applicant is sentenced to imprisonment or death; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) another Federal or State offense, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) evidence of such offense was admitted during a Federal sentencing hearing and exoneration of such offense would entitle the applicant to a reduced sentence or new sentencing hearing; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) in the case of a State offense&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the applicant demonstrates that there is no adequate remedy under State law to permit DNA testing of the specified evidence relating to the State offense; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) to the extent available, the applicant has exhausted all remedies available under State law for requesting DNA testing of specified evidence relating to the State offense.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The specific evidence to be tested was secured in relation to the investigation or prosecution of the Federal or State offense referenced in the applicant's assertion under paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The specific evidence to be tested&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) was not previously subjected to DNA testing and the applicant did not knowingly fail to request DNA testing of that evidence in a prior motion for postconviction DNA testing; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) was previously subjected to DNA testing and the applicant is requesting DNA testing using a new method or technology that is substantially more probative than the prior DNA testing.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The specific evidence to be tested is in the possession of the Government and has been subject to a chain of custody and retained under conditions sufficient to ensure that such evidence has not been substituted, contaminated, tampered with, replaced, or altered in any respect material to the proposed DNA testing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The proposed DNA testing is reasonable in scope, uses scientifically sound methods, and is consistent with accepted forensic practices.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The applicant identifies a theory of defense that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is not inconsistent with an affirmative defense presented at trial; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) would establish the actual innocence of the applicant of the Federal or State offense referenced in the applicant's assertion under paragraph (1).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) If the applicant was convicted following a trial, the identity of the perpetrator was at issue in the trial.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) The proposed DNA testing of the specific evidence may produce new material evidence that would&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) support the theory of defense referenced in paragraph (6); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) raise a reasonable probability that the applicant did not commit the offense.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) The applicant certifies that the applicant will provide a DNA sample for purposes of comparison.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) The motion is made in a timely fashion, subject to the following conditions:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) There shall be a rebuttable presumption of timeliness if the motion is made within 60 months of enactment of the Justice For All Act of 2004 or within 36 months of conviction, whichever comes later. Such presumption may be rebutted upon a showing&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) that the applicant's motion for a DNA test is based solely upon information used in a previously denied motion; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) of clear and convincing evidence that the applicant's filing is done solely to cause delay or harass.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:824 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) There shall be a rebuttable presumption against timeliness for any motion not satisfying subparagraph (A) above. Such presumption may be rebutted upon the court's finding&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) that the applicant was or is incompetent and such incompetence substantially contributed to the delay in the applicant's motion for a DNA test;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the evidence to be tested is newly discovered DNA evidence;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) that the applicant's motion is not based solely upon the applicant's own assertion of innocence and, after considering all relevant facts and circumstances surrounding the motion, a denial would result in a manifest injustice; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) upon good cause shown.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) For purposes of this paragraph&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the term &quot;incompetence&quot; has the meaning as defined in section 4241 of title 18, United States Code;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the term &quot;manifest&quot; means that which is unmistakable, clear, plain, or indisputable and requires that the opposite conclusion be clearly evident.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Notice to the Government; Preservation Order; Appointment of Counsel.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Notice</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Upon the receipt of a motion filed under subsection (a), the court shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) notify the Government;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) allow the Government a reasonable time period to respond to the motion; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) order the Government to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) prepare an inventory of the evidence related to the case; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) issue a copy of the inventory to the court, the applicant, and the Government.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Preservation order</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;To the extent necessary to carry out proceedings under this section, the court shall direct the Government to preserve the specific evidence relating to a motion under subsection (a).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Appointment of counsel</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The court may appoint counsel for an indigent applicant under this section in the same manner as in a proceeding under section 3006A(a)(2)(B).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Testing Procedures.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The court shall direct that any DNA testing ordered under this section be carried out by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Exception</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding paragraph (1), the court may order DNA testing by another qualified laboratory if the court makes all necessary orders to ensure the integrity of the specific evidence and the reliability of the testing process and test results.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Costs</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The costs of any DNA testing ordered under this section shall be paid&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) by the applicant; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in the case of an applicant who is indigent, by the Government.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Time Limitation in Capital Cases</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In any case in which the applicant is sentenced to death&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) any DNA testing ordered under this section shall be completed not later than 60 days after the date on which the Government responds to the motion filed under subsection (a); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) not later than 120 days after the date on which the DNA testing ordered under this section is completed, the court shall order any post-testing procedures under subsection (f) or (g), as appropriate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Reporting of Test Results.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Results.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The results of any DNA testing ordered under this section shall be simultaneously disclosed to the court, the applicant, and the Government.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Results exclude applicant.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If a DNA profile is obtained through testing that excludes the applicant as the source and the DNA complies with the Federal Bureau of Investigation's requirements for the uploading of crime scene profiles to the National DNA Index System (referred to in this subsection as &quot;NDIS&quot;), the court shall order that the law enforcement entity with direct or conveyed statutory jurisdiction that has access to the NDIS submit the DNA profile obtained from probative biological material from crime scene evidence to determine whether the DNA profile matches a profile of a known individual or a profile from an unsolved crime.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) <cap-smallcap>NDIS search</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The results of a search under clause (i) shall be simultaneously disclosed to the court, the applicant, and the Government.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) NDIS.&mdash;The Government shall submit any test results relating to the DNA of the applicant to NDIS.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Retention of dna sample.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>Entry into ndis</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the DNA test results obtained under this section are inconclusive or show that the applicant was the source of the DNA evidence, the DNA sample of the applicant may be retained in NDIS.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Match with other offense</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the DNA test results obtained under this section exclude the applicant as the source of the DNA evidence, and a comparison of the DNA sample of the applicant results in a match between the DNA sample of the applicant and another offense, the Attorney General shall notify the appropriate agency and preserve the DNA sample of the applicant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) <cap-smallcap>No match</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the DNA test results obtained under this section exclude the applicant as the source of the DNA evidence, and a comparison of the DNA sample of the applicant does not result in a match between the DNA sample of the applicant and another offense, the Attorney General shall destroy the DNA sample of the applicant and ensure that such information is not retained in NDIS if there is no other legal authority to retain the DNA sample of the applicant in NDIS.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Post-Testing Procedures; Inconclusive and Inculpatory Results.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Inconclusive results</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If DNA test results obtained under this section are inconclusive, the court may order further testing, if appropriate, or may deny the applicant relief.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:825 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Inculpatory results</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If DNA test results obtained under this section show that the applicant was the source of the DNA evidence, the court shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) deny the applicant relief; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) on motion of the Government&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) make a determination whether the applicant's assertion of actual innocence was false, and, if the court makes such a finding, the court may hold the applicant in contempt;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) assess against the applicant the cost of any DNA testing carried out under this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) forward the finding to the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, who, upon receipt of such a finding, may deny, wholly or in part, the good conduct credit authorized under section 3632 on the basis of that finding;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) if the applicant is subject to the jurisdiction of the United States Parole Commission, forward the finding to the Commission so that the Commission may deny parole on the basis of that finding; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) if the DNA test results relate to a State offense, forward the finding to any appropriate State official.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Sentence</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In any prosecution of an applicant under chapter 79 for false assertions or other conduct in proceedings under this section, the court, upon conviction of the applicant, shall sentence the applicant to a term of imprisonment of not less than 3 years, which shall run consecutively to any other term of imprisonment the applicant is serving.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Post-Testing Procedures; Motion for New Trial or Resentencing.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding any law that would bar a motion under this paragraph as untimely, if DNA test results obtained under this section exclude the applicant as the source of the DNA evidence, the applicant may file a motion for a new trial or resentencing, as appropriate. The court shall establish a reasonable schedule for the applicant to file such a motion and for the Government to respond to the motion.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Standard for granting motion for new trial or resentencing</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The court shall grant the motion of the applicant for a new trial or resentencing, as appropriate, if the DNA test results, when considered with all other evidence in the case (regardless of whether such evidence was introduced at trial), establish by compelling evidence that a new trial would result in an acquittal of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in the case of a motion for a new trial, the Federal offense for which the applicant is sentenced to imprisonment or death; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in the case of a motion for resentencing, another Federal or State offense, if evidence of such offense was admitted during a Federal sentencing hearing and exoneration of such offense would entitle the applicant to a reduced sentence or a new sentencing proceeding.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Other Laws Unaffected.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Post-conviction relief</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Nothing in this section shall affect the circumstances under which a person may obtain DNA testing or post-conviction relief under any other law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Habeas corpus</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Nothing in this section shall provide a basis for relief in any Federal habeas corpus proceeding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Not a motion under section 2255</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A motion under this section shall not be considered to be a motion under section 2255 for purposes of determining whether the motion or any other motion is a second or successive motion under section 2255.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Enforcement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The United States may enforce a judgment imposing a fine in accordance with the practices and procedures for the enforcement of a civil judgment under Federal law or State law. Notwithstanding any other Federal law (including section 207 of the Social Security Act), a judgment imposing a fine may be enforced against all property or rights to property of the person fined, except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) property exempt from levy for taxes pursuant to section 6334(a)(1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8), (10), and (12) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 shall be exempt from enforcement of the judgment under Federal law;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) section 3014 of chapter 176 of title 28 shall not apply to enforcement under Federal law; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the provisions of section 303 of the Consumer Credit Protection Act (15 U.S.C. 1673) shall apply to enforcement of the judgment under Federal law or State law.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Termination of Liability</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The liability to pay a fine shall terminate the later of 20 years from the entry of judgment or 20 years after the release from imprisonment of the person fined, or upon the death of the individual fined. The liability to pay restitution shall terminate on the date that is the later of 20 years from the entry of judgment or 20 years after the release from imprisonment of the person ordered to pay restitution. In the event of the death of the person ordered to pay restitution, the individual's estate will be held responsible for any unpaid balance of the restitution amount, and the lien provided in subsection (c) of this section shall continue until the estate receives a written release of that liability.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Lien</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A fine imposed pursuant to the provisions of subchapter C of chapter 227 of this title, an assessment imposed pursuant to section 2259A of this title, or an order of restitution made pursuant to sections&#160;<sup><a href="#3613_1_target" name="3613_1">1</a></sup> 2248, 2259, 2264, 2327, 3663, 3663A, or 3664 of this title, is a lien in favor of the United States on all property and rights to property of the person fined as if the liability of the person fined were a liability for a tax assessed under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The lien arises on the entry of judgment and continues for 20 years or until the liability is satisfied, remitted, set aside, or is terminated under subsection (b).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Effect of Filing Notice of Lien</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Upon filing of a notice of lien in the manner in which a notice of tax lien would be filed under section 6323(f)(1) and (2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, the lien shall be valid against any purchaser, holder of a security interest, mechanic's lienor or judgment lien creditor, except with respect to properties or transactions specified in subsection (b), (c), or (d) of section 6323 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 for which a notice of tax lien properly filed on the same date would not be valid. The notice of lien shall be considered a notice of lien for taxes payable to the United States for the purpose of any State or local law providing for the filing of a notice of a tax lien. A notice of lien that is registered, recorded, docketed, or indexed in accordance with the rules and requirements relating to judgments of the courts of the State where the notice of lien is registered, recorded, docketed, or indexed shall be considered for all purposes as the filing prescribed by this section. The provisions of section 3201(e) of chapter 176 of title 28 shall apply to liens filed as prescribed by this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Discharge of Debt Inapplicable</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;No discharge of debts in a proceeding pursuant to any chapter of title 11, United States Code, shall discharge liability to pay a fine pursuant to this section, and a lien filed as prescribed by this section shall not be voided in a bankruptcy proceeding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Applicability to Order of Restitution</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In accordance with section 3664(m)(1)(A) of this title, all provisions of this section are available to the United States for the enforcement of an order of restitution.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Commitment to Custody of Bureau of Prisons</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A person who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment pursuant to the provisions of subchapter D of chapter 227 shall be committed to the custody of the Bureau of Prisons until the expiration of the term imposed, or until earlier released for satisfactory behavior pursuant to the provisions of section 3624.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Place of Imprisonment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Bureau of Prisons shall designate the place of the prisoner's imprisonment, and shall, subject to bed availability, the prisoner's security designation, the prisoner's programmatic needs, the prisoner's mental and medical health needs, any request made by the prisoner related to faith-based needs, recommendations of the sentencing court, and other security concerns of the Bureau of Prisons, place the prisoner in a facility as close as practicable to the prisoner's primary residence, and to the extent practicable, in a facility within 500 driving miles of that residence. The Bureau shall, subject to consideration of the factors described in the preceding sentence and the prisoner's preference for staying at his or her current facility or being transferred, transfer prisoners to facilities that are closer to the prisoner's primary residence even if the prisoner is already in a facility within 500 driving miles of that residence. The Bureau may designate any available penal or correctional facility that meets minimum standards of health and habitability established by the Bureau, whether maintained by the Federal Government or otherwise and whether within or without the judicial district in which the person was convicted, that the Bureau determines to be appropriate and suitable, considering&mdash;</p>

The Bureau may at any time, having regard for the same matters, direct the transfer of a prisoner from one penal or correctional facility to another. The Bureau shall make available appropriate substance abuse treatment for each prisoner the Bureau determines has a treatable condition of substance addiction or abuse. Any order, recommendation, or request by a sentencing court that a convicted person serve a term of imprisonment in a community corrections facility shall have no binding effect on the authority of the Bureau under this section to determine or change the place of imprisonment of that person. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a designation of a place of imprisonment <!-- PDFPage:837 -->under this subsection is not reviewable by any court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Delivery of Order of Commitment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When a prisoner, pursuant to a court order, is placed in the custody of a person in charge of a penal or correctional facility, a copy of the order shall be delivered to such person as evidence of this authority to hold the prisoner, and the original order, with the return endorsed thereon, shall be returned to the court that issued it.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) for not less than 50 percent of eligible prisoners by the end of fiscal year 1995, with priority for such treatment accorded based on an eligible prisoner's proximity to release date;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) for not less than 75 percent of eligible prisoners by the end of fiscal year 1996, with priority for such treatment accorded based on an eligible prisoner's proximity to release date; and</p>

<p class="note-body-3em">&quot;(i) There is an urgent need for personal protective equipment and test kits to the Bureau based on the density of the inmate population, the high traffic, the high volume of inmates, the high rate of turnover of inmates and personnel, and the number of high-security areas, within the facilities of the Bureau.</p>
<p class="note-body-3em">&quot;(ii) The inability of the Bureau to secure the purchase of infectious disease personal protective equipment and related supplies now and in the future is a vulnerability.</p>

<p class="note-body">The development of the occupational and educational skills of prison inmates is essential to their rehabilitation and to their ability to make an effective return to free society. Meaningful employment serves to develop those skills. It is also true, however, that care must be exercised to avoid either the exploitation of convict labor or any unfair competition between convict labor and free labor in the production of goods and services.</p>
<p class="note-body">Under sections 3621 and 3622 of title 18, United States Code, the Bureau of Prisons is empowered to authorize Federal prisoners to work at paid employment in the community during their terms of imprisonment under conditions that protect against both the exploitation of convict labor and unfair competition with free labor.</p>
<p class="note-body">Several states and other jurisdictions have similar laws or regulations under which individuals confined for violations of the laws of those places may be authorized to work at paid employment in the community.</p>
<p class="note-body">Executive Order No. 325A, which was originally issued by President Theodore Roosevelt in 1905, prohibits the employment, in the performance of Federal contracts, of any person who is serving a sentence of imprisonment at hard labor imposed by a court of a State, territory, or municipality.</p>
<p class="note-body">I have now determined that Executive Order No. 325A should be replaced with a new Executive Order which would permit the employment of non-Federal prison inmates in the performance of Federal contracts under terms and conditions that are comparable to those now applicable to inmates of Federal prisons.</p>
<p class="note-body">NOW, THEREFORE, pursuant to the authority vested in me as President of the United States, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1.

This limitation, however, shall not prohibit the employment by a contractor in the performance of such contracts of persons on parole or probation to work at paid employment during the term of their sentence or persons who have been pardoned or who have served their terms. Nor shall it prohibit the employment by a contractor in the performance of such contracts of persons confined for violation of the laws of any of the States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands who are authorized to work at paid employment in the community under the laws of such jurisdiction, if</p>
<p class="note-body">(1)(A) The worker is paid or is in an approved work training program on a voluntary basis;</p>
<p class="note-body">(B) Representatives of local union central bodies or similar labor union organizations have been consulted;</p>
<p class="note-body">(C) Such paid employment will not result in the displacement of employed workers, or be applied in skills, crafts, or trades in which there is a surplus of available gainful labor in the locality, or impair existing contracts for services; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(D) The rates of pay and other conditions of employment will not be less than those paid or provided for work of a similar nature in the locality in which the work is being performed; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) The Attorney General has certified that the work-release laws or regulations of the jurisdiction involved are in conformity with the requirements of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) After notice and opportunity for hearing, the Attorney General shall revoke any such certification under section 1(a)(2) if he finds that the work-release program of the jurisdiction involved is not being conducted in conformity with the requirements of this order or with its intent or purposes.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) The provisions of this order do not apply to purchases made under the micropurchase authority contained in section 32 of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act, as amended [now 41 U.S.C. 1902].</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Date of Release</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A prisoner shall be released by the Bureau of Prisons on the date of the expiration of the prisoner's term of imprisonment, less any time credited toward the service of the prisoner's sentence as provided in subsection (b). If the date for a prisoner's release falls on a Saturday, a Sunday, or a legal holiday at the place of confinement, the prisoner may be released by the Bureau on the last preceding weekday.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Credit Toward Service of Sentence for Satisfactory Behavior</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Subject to paragraph (2), a prisoner who is serving a term of imprisonment of more than 1 year&#160;<sup><a href="#3624_1_target" name="3624_1">1</a></sup> other than a term of imprisonment for the duration of the prisoner's life, may receive credit toward the service of the prisoner's sentence of up to 54 days for each year of the prisoner's sentence imposed by the court, subject to determination by the Bureau of Prisons that, during that year, the prisoner has displayed exemplary compliance with institutional disciplinary regulations. Subject to paragraph (2), if the Bureau determines that, during that year, the prisoner has not satisfactorily complied with such institutional regulations, the prisoner shall receive no such credit toward service of the prisoner's sentence or shall receive such lesser credit as the Bureau determines to be appropriate. In awarding credit under this section, the Bureau shall consider whether the prisoner, during the relevant period, has earned, or is making satisfactory progress toward earning, a high school diploma or an equivalent degree. Credit that has not been earned may not later be granted. Subject to paragraph (2), credit for the last year of a term of imprisonment shall be credited on the first day of the last year of the term of imprisonment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding any other law, credit awarded under this subsection after the date of enactment of the Prison Litigation Reform Act shall vest on the date the prisoner is released from custody.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Attorney General shall ensure that the Bureau of Prisons has in effect an optional General Educational Development program for inmates who have not earned a high school diploma or its equivalent.</p>

Such conditions may include a community correctional facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Home confinement authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The authority under this subsection may be used to place a prisoner in home confinement for the shorter of 10 percent of the term of imprisonment of that prisoner or 6 months. The Bureau of Prisons shall, to the extent practicable, place prisoners with lower risk levels and lower needs on home confinement for the maximum amount of time permitted under this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Assistance</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The United States Probation System shall, to the extent practicable, offer assistance to a prisoner during prerelease custody under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>No limitations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to limit or restrict the authority of the Director of the Bureau of Prisons under section 3621.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) <cap-smallcap>Reporting</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than 1 year after the date of the enactment of the Second Chance Act of 2007 (and every year thereafter), the Director of the Bureau of Prisons shall transmit to the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate and the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives a report describing the Bureau's utilization of community corrections facilities. Each report under this paragraph shall set forth the number and percentage of Federal prisoners placed in community corrections facilities during the preceding year, the average length of such placements, trends in such utilization, the reasons some prisoners are not placed in community corrections facilities, and number of prisoners not being placed in community corrections facilities for each reason set forth, and any other information that may be useful to the committees in determining if the Bureau is utilizing community corrections facilities in an effective manner.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) <cap-smallcap>Issuance of regulations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Director of the Bureau of Prisons shall issue regulations pursuant to this subsection not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of the Second Chance Reauthorization Act of 2018, which shall ensure that placement in a community correctional facility by the Bureau of Prisons is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) conducted in a manner consistent with section 3621(b) of this title;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Supervision After Release</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A prisoner whose sentence includes a term of supervised release after imprisonment shall be released by the Bureau of Prisons to the supervision of a probation officer who shall, during the term imposed, supervise the person released to the degree warranted by the conditions specified by the sentencing court. The term of supervised release commences on the day the person is released from imprisonment and runs concurrently with any Federal, State, or local term of probation or supervised release or parole for another offense to which the person is subject or becomes subject during the term of supervised release. A term of supervised release does not run during any period in which the person is imprisoned in connection with a conviction for a Federal, State, or local crime unless the imprisonment is for a period of less than 30 consecutive days. Upon the release of a prisoner by the Bureau of Prisons to supervised release, the Bureau of Prisons shall notify such prisoner, verbally and in writing, of the requirement that the prisoner adhere to an installment schedule, not to exceed 2 years except in special circumstances, to pay for any fine imposed for the offense committed by such prisoner, and of the consequences of failure to pay such fines under sections 3611 through 3614 of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) functional competency or literacy on a nationally recognized criterion-referenced test; or</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Requirements for Relief.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Prospective relief</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(A) Prospective relief in any civil action with respect to prison conditions shall extend no further than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right of a particular plaintiff or plaintiffs. The court shall not grant or approve any prospective relief unless the court finds that such relief is narrowly drawn, extends no further than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right, and is the least intrusive means necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right. The court shall give substantial weight to any adverse impact on public safety or the operation of a criminal justice system caused by the relief.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The court shall not order any prospective relief that requires or permits a government official to exceed his or her authority under State or local law or otherwise violates State or local law, unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) Federal law requires such relief to be ordered in violation of State or local law;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the relief is necessary to correct the violation of a Federal right; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) no other relief will correct the violation of the Federal right.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the courts, in exercising their remedial powers, to order the construction of prisons or the raising of taxes, or to repeal or detract from otherwise applicable limitations on the remedial powers of the courts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Preliminary injunctive relief</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In any civil action with respect to prison conditions, to the extent otherwise authorized by law, the court may enter a temporary restraining order or an order for preliminary injunctive relief. Preliminary injunctive relief must be narrowly drawn, extend no further than necessary to correct the harm the court finds requires preliminary relief, and be the least intrusive means necessary to correct that harm. The court shall give substantial weight to any adverse impact on public safety or the operation of a criminal justice system caused by the preliminary relief and shall respect the principles of comity set out in paragraph (1)(B) in tailoring any preliminary relief. Preliminary injunctive relief shall automatically expire on the date that is 90 days after its entry, unless the court makes the findings required under subsection (a)(1) for the entry of prospective relief and makes the order final before the expiration of the 90-day period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Prisoner release order</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(A) In any civil action with respect to prison conditions, no court shall enter a prisoner release order unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) a court has previously entered an order for less intrusive relief that has failed to remedy the deprivation of the Federal right sought to be remedied through the prisoner release order; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the defendant has had a reasonable amount of time to comply with the previous court orders.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) In any civil action in Federal court with respect to prison conditions, a prisoner release order shall be entered only by a three-judge court in accordance with section 2284 of title 28, if the requirements of subparagraph (E) have been met.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) A party seeking a prisoner release order in Federal court shall file with any request for such relief, a request for a three-judge court and materials sufficient to demonstrate that the requirements of subparagraph (A) have been met.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) If the requirements under subparagraph (A) have been met, a Federal judge before whom a civil action with respect to prison conditions is pending who believes that a prison release order should be considered may sua sponte request the convening of a three-judge court to determine whether a prisoner release order should be entered.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) The three-judge court shall enter a prisoner release order only if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) crowding is the primary cause of the violation of a Federal right; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) no other relief will remedy the violation of the Federal right.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) Any State or local official including a legislator or unit of government whose jurisdiction or function includes the appropriation of funds for the construction, operation, or maintenance of prison facilities, or the prosecution or custody of persons who may be released from, or not admitted to, a prison as a result of a prisoner release order shall have standing to oppose the imposition or continuation in effect of such relief and to seek termination of such relief, and shall have the right to intervene in any proceeding relating to such relief.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Termination of Relief.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Termination of prospective relief</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(A) In any civil action with respect to prison conditions in which prospective relief is ordered, such relief shall be terminable upon the motion of any party or intervener&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) 2 years after the date the court granted or approved the prospective relief;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) 1 year after the date the court has entered an order denying termination of prospective relief under this paragraph; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) in the case of an order issued on or before the date of enactment of the Prison Litigation Reform Act, 2 years after such date of enactment.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Nothing in this section shall prevent the parties from agreeing to terminate or modify relief before the relief is terminated under subparagraph (A).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Immediate termination of prospective relief</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In any civil action with respect to prison conditions, a defendant or intervener shall be entitled to the immediate termination <!-- PDFPage:849 -->of any prospective relief if the relief was approved or granted in the absence of a finding by the court that the relief is narrowly drawn, extends no further than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right, and is the least intrusive means necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Limitation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Prospective relief shall not terminate if the court makes written findings based on the record that prospective relief remains necessary to correct a current and ongoing violation of the Federal right, extends no further than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right, and that the prospective relief is narrowly drawn and the least intrusive means to correct the violation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Termination or modification of relief</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Nothing in this section shall prevent any party or intervener from seeking modification or termination before the relief is terminable under paragraph (1) or (2), to the extent that modification or termination would otherwise be legally permissible.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Settlements.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Consent decrees</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In any civil action with respect to prison conditions, the court shall not enter or approve a consent decree unless it complies with the limitations on relief set forth in subsection (a).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Private settlement agreements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(A) Nothing in this section shall preclude parties from entering into a private settlement agreement that does not comply with the limitations on relief set forth in subsection (a), if the terms of that agreement are not subject to court enforcement other than the reinstatement of the civil proceeding that the agreement settled.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Nothing in this section shall preclude any party claiming that a private settlement agreement has been breached from seeking in State court any remedy available under State law.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>State Law Remedies</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The limitations on remedies in this section shall not apply to relief entered by a State court based solely upon claims arising under State law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Procedure for Motions Affecting Prospective Relief.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Generally</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The court shall promptly rule on any motion to modify or terminate prospective relief in a civil action with respect to prison conditions. Mandamus shall lie to remedy any failure to issue a prompt ruling on such a motion.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Automatic stay</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Any motion to modify or terminate prospective relief made under subsection (b) shall operate as a stay during the period&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A)(i) beginning on the 30th day after such motion is filed, in the case of a motion made under paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection (b); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) beginning on the 180th day after such motion is filed, in the case of a motion made under any other law; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) ending on the date the court enters a final order ruling on the motion.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Postponement of automatic stay</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The court may postpone the effective date of an automatic stay specified in subsection (e)(2)(A) for not more than 60 days for good cause. No postponement shall be permissible because of general congestion of the court's calendar.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Order blocking the automatic stay</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Any order staying, suspending, delaying, or barring the operation of the automatic stay described in paragraph (2) (other than an order to postpone the effective date of the automatic stay under paragraph (3)) shall be treated as an order refusing to dissolve or modify an injunction and shall be appealable pursuant to section 1292(a)(1) of title 28, United States Code, regardless of how the order is styled or whether the order is termed a preliminary or a final ruling.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Special Masters.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(A) In any civil action in a Federal court with respect to prison conditions, the court may appoint a special master who shall be disinterested and objective and who will give due regard to the public safety, to conduct hearings on the record and prepare proposed findings of fact.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The court shall appoint a special master under this subsection during the remedial phase of the action only upon a finding that the remedial phase will be sufficiently complex to warrant the appointment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Appointment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(A) If the court determines that the appointment of a special master is necessary, the court shall request that the defendant institution and the plaintiff each submit a list of not more than 5 persons to serve as a special master.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Each party shall have the opportunity to remove up to 3 persons from the opposing party's list.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The court shall select the master from the persons remaining on the list after the operation of subparagraph (B).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Interlocutory appeal</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Any party shall have the right to an interlocutory appeal of the judge's selection of the special master under this subsection, on the ground of partiality.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Compensation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The compensation to be allowed to a special master under this section shall be based on an hourly rate not greater than the hourly rate established under section 3006A for payment of court-appointed counsel, plus costs reasonably incurred by the special master. Such compensation and costs shall be paid with funds appropriated to the Judiciary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) <cap-smallcap>Regular review of appointment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In any civil action with respect to prison conditions in which a special master is appointed under this subsection, the court shall review the appointment of the special master every 6 months to determine whether the services of the special master continue to be required under paragraph (1). In no event shall the appointment of a special master extend beyond the termination of the relief.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) <cap-smallcap>Limitations on powers and duties</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A special master appointed under this subsection&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) may be authorized by a court to conduct hearings and prepare proposed findings of fact, which shall be made on the record;</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1)(A) The court, when sentencing a defendant convicted of an offense under this title, section 401, 408(a), 409, 416, 420, or 422(a) of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 841, 848(a), 849, 856, 861, 863) (but in no case shall a participant in an offense under such sections be considered a victim of such offense under this section), or section 5124, 46312, 46502, or 46504 of title 49, other than an offense described in section 3663A(c), may order, in addition to or, in the case of a misdemeanor, in lieu of any other penalty authorized by law, that the defendant make restitution to any victim of such offense, or if the victim is deceased, to the victim's estate. The court may also order, if agreed to by the parties in a plea agreement, restitution to persons other than the victim of the offense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) The court, in determining whether to order restitution under this section, shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) the amount of the loss sustained by each victim as a result of the offense; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) the financial resources of the defendant, the financial needs and earning ability of the defendant and the defendant's dependents, and such other factors as the court deems appropriate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) To the extent that the court determines that the complication and prolongation of the sentencing process resulting from the fashioning of an order of restitution under this section outweighs the need to provide restitution to any victims, the court may decline to make such an order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For the purposes of this section, the term &quot;victim&quot; means a person directly and proximately harmed as a result of the commission of an offense for which restitution may be ordered including, in the case of an offense that involves as an element a scheme, conspiracy, or pattern of criminal activity, any person directly harmed by the defendant's criminal conduct in the course of the scheme, conspiracy, or pattern. In the case of a victim who is under 18 years of age, incompetent, incapacitated, or deceased, the legal guardian of the victim or representative of the victim's estate, another family member, or any other person appointed as suitable by the court, may assume the victim's rights under this section, but in no event shall the defendant be named as such representative or guardian.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The court may also order restitution in any criminal case to the extent agreed to by the parties in a plea agreement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The order may require that such defendant&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in the case of an offense resulting in damage to or loss or destruction of property of a victim of the offense&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) return the property to the owner of the property or someone designated by the owner; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if return of the property under subparagraph (A) is impossible, impractical, or inadequate, pay an amount equal to the greater of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the value of the property on the date of the damage, loss, or destruction, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the value of the property on the date of sentencing,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">less the value (as of the date the property is returned) of any part of the property that is returned;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in the case of an offense resulting in bodily injury to a victim including an offense under chapter 109A or chapter 110&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) pay an amount equal to the cost of necessary medical and related professional services and devices relating to physical, psychiatric, and psychological care, including nonmedical care and treatment rendered in accordance with a method of healing recognized by the law of the place of treatment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) pay an amount equal to the cost of necessary physical and occupational therapy and rehabilitation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) reimburse the victim for income lost by such victim as a result of such offense;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) in the case of an offense resulting in bodily injury also results in the death of a victim, pay an amount equal to the cost of necessary funeral and related services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) in any case, reimburse the victim for lost income and necessary child care, transportation, and other expenses related to participation in the investigation or prosecution of the offense or attendance at proceedings related to the offense;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) in any case, if the victim (or if the victim is deceased, the victim's estate) consents, <!-- PDFPage:861 -->make restitution in services in lieu of money, or make restitution to a person or organization designated by the victim or the estate; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) in the case of an offense under sections 1028(a)(7) or 1028A(a) of this title, pay an amount equal to the value of the time reasonably spent by the victim in an attempt to remediate the intended or actual harm incurred by the victim from the offense.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law (but subject to the provisions of subsections (a)(1)(B)(i)(II) and (ii),<sup><a href="#3663_1_target" name="3663_1">1</a></sup> when sentencing a defendant convicted of an offense described in section 401, 408(a), 409, 416, 420, or 422(a) of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 841, 848(a), 849, 856, 861, 863), in which there is no identifiable victim, the court may order that the defendant make restitution in accordance with this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) An order of restitution under this subsection shall be based on the amount of public harm caused by the offense, as determined by the court in accordance with guidelines promulgated by the United States Sentencing Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In no case shall the amount of restitution ordered under this subsection exceed the amount of the fine which may be ordered for the offense charged in the case.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Restitution under this subsection shall be distributed as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) 65 percent of the total amount of restitution shall be paid to the State entity designated to administer crime victim assistance in the State in which the crime occurred.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) 35 percent of the total amount of restitution shall be paid to the State entity designated to receive Federal substance abuse block grant funds.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The court shall not make an award under this subsection if it appears likely that such award would interfere with a forfeiture under chapter 46 or chapter 96 of this title or under the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 801 et seq.).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Notwithstanding section 3612(c) or any other provision of law, a penalty assessment under section 3013 or a fine under subchapter C of chapter 227 shall take precedence over an order of restitution under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Requests for community restitution under this subsection may be considered in all plea agreements negotiated by the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7)(A) The United States Sentencing Commission shall promulgate guidelines to assist courts in determining the amount of restitution that may be ordered under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) No restitution shall be ordered under this subsection until such time as the Sentencing Commission promulgates guidelines pursuant to this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) An order of restitution made pursuant to this section shall be issued and enforced in accordance with section 3664.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, when sentencing a defendant convicted of an offense described in subsection (c), the court <!-- PDFPage:863 -->shall order, in addition to, or in the case of a misdemeanor, in addition to or in lieu of, any other penalty authorized by law, that the defendant make restitution to the victim of the offense or, if the victim is deceased, to the victim's estate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For the purposes of this section, the term &quot;victim&quot; means a person directly and proximately harmed as a result of the commission of an offense for which restitution may be ordered including, in the case of an offense that involves as an element a scheme, conspiracy, or pattern of criminal activity, any person directly harmed by the defendant's criminal conduct in the course of the scheme, conspiracy, or pattern. In the case of a victim who is under 18 years of age, incompetent, incapacitated, or deceased, the legal guardian of the victim or representative of the victim's estate, another family member, or any other person appointed as suitable by the court, may assume the victim's rights under this section, but in no event shall the defendant be named as such representative or guardian.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The court shall also order, if agreed to by the parties in a plea agreement, restitution to persons other than the victim of the offense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The order of restitution shall require that such defendant&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in the case of an offense resulting in damage to or loss or destruction of property of a victim of the offense&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) return the property to the owner of the property or someone designated by the owner; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if return of the property under subparagraph (A) is impossible, impracticable, or inadequate, pay an amount equal to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the greater of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the value of the property on the date of the damage, loss, or destruction; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the value of the property on the date of sentencing, less</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the value (as of the date the property is returned) of any part of the property that is returned;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in the case of an offense resulting in bodily injury to a victim&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) pay an amount equal to the cost of necessary medical and related professional services and devices relating to physical, psychiatric, and psychological care, including nonmedical care and treatment rendered in accordance with a method of healing recognized by the law of the place of treatment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) pay an amount equal to the cost of necessary physical and occupational therapy and rehabilitation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) reimburse the victim for income lost by such victim as a result of such offense;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) in the case of an offense resulting in bodily injury that results in the death of the victim, pay an amount equal to the cost of necessary funeral and related services; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) in any case, reimburse the victim for lost income and necessary child care, transportation, and other expenses incurred during participation in the investigation or prosecution of the offense or attendance at proceedings related to the offense.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) This section shall apply in all sentencing proceedings for convictions of, or plea agreements relating to charges for, any offense&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) that is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) a crime of violence, as defined in section 16;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) an offense against property under this title, or under section 416(a) of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 856(a)), including any offense committed by fraud or deceit;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) an offense described in section 3 of the Rodchenkov Anti-Doping Act of 2019;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) an offense described in section 1365 (relating to tampering with consumer products); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(v) an offense under section 670 (relating to theft of medical products); and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in which an identifiable victim or victims has suffered a physical injury or pecuniary loss.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In the case of a plea agreement that does not result in a conviction for an offense described in paragraph (1), this section shall apply only if the plea specifically states that an offense listed under such paragraph gave rise to the plea agreement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) This section shall not apply in the case of an offense described in paragraph (1)(A)(ii) or (iii) if the court finds, from facts on the record, that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the number of identifiable victims is so large as to make restitution impracticable; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) determining complex issues of fact related to the cause or amount of the victim's losses would complicate or prolong the sentencing process to a degree that the need to provide restitution to any victim is outweighed by the burden on the sentencing process.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) An order of restitution under this section shall be issued and enforced in accordance with section 3664.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;3664. Procedure for issuance and enforcement of order of restitution</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) For orders of restitution under this title, the court shall order the probation officer to obtain and include in its presentence report, or in a separate report, as the court may direct, information sufficient for the court to exercise its discretion in fashioning a restitution order. The report shall include, to the extent practicable, a complete accounting of the losses to each victim, any restitution owed pursuant to a plea agreement, and information relating to the economic circumstances of each defendant. If the number or identity of victims cannot be reasonably ascertained, or other circumstances exist that make this requirement clearly impracticable, the probation officer shall so inform the court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The court shall disclose to both the defendant and the attorney for the Government all portions of the presentence or other report pertaining to the matters described in subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The provisions of this chapter, chapter 227, and Rule 32(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure shall be the only rules applicable to proceedings under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) Upon the request of the probation officer, but not later than 60 days prior to the date initially set for sentencing, the attorney for the Government, after consulting, to the extent practicable, with all identified victims, shall promptly provide the probation officer with a listing of the amounts subject to restitution.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The probation officer shall, prior to submitting the presentence report under subsection (a), to the extent practicable&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) provide notice to all identified victims of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the offense or offenses of which the defendant was convicted;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the amounts subject to restitution submitted to the probation officer;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) the opportunity of the victim to submit information to the probation officer concerning the amount of the victim's losses;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) the scheduled date, time, and place of the sentencing hearing;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(v) the availability of a lien in favor of the victim pursuant to subsection (m)(1)(B); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(vi) the opportunity of the victim to file with the probation officer a separate affidavit relating to the amount of the victim's losses subject to restitution; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) provide the victim with an affidavit form to submit pursuant to subparagraph (A)(vi).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Each defendant shall prepare and file with the probation officer an affidavit fully describing the financial resources of the defendant, including a complete listing of all assets owned or controlled by the defendant as of the date on which the defendant was arrested, the financial needs and earning ability of the defendant and the defendant's dependents, and such other information that the court requires relating to such other factors as the court deems appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) After reviewing the report of the probation officer, the court may require additional documentation or hear testimony. The privacy of any records filed, or testimony heard, pursuant to this section shall be maintained to the greatest extent possible, and such records may be filed or testimony heard in camera.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) If the victim's losses are not ascertainable by the date that is 10 days prior to sentencing, the attorney for the Government or the probation officer shall so inform the court, and the court shall set a date for the final determination of the victim's losses, not to exceed 90 days after sentencing. If the victim subsequently discovers further losses, the victim shall have 60 days after discovery of those losses in which to petition the court for an amended restitution order. Such order may be granted only upon a showing of good cause for the failure to include such losses in the initial claim for restitutionary relief.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) The court may refer any issue arising in connection with a proposed order of restitution to a magistrate judge or special master for proposed findings of fact and recommendations as to disposition, subject to a de novo determination of the issue by the court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Any dispute as to the proper amount or type of restitution shall be resolved by the court by the preponderance of the evidence. The burden of demonstrating the amount of the loss sustained by a victim as a result of the offense shall be on the attorney for the Government. The burden of demonstrating the financial resources of the defendant and the financial needs of the defendant's dependents, shall be on the defendant. The burden of demonstrating such other matters as the court deems appropriate shall be upon the party designated by the court as justice requires.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f)(1)(A) In each order of restitution, the court shall order restitution to each victim in the full amount of each victim's losses as determined by the court and without consideration of the economic circumstances of the defendant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In no case shall the fact that a victim has received or is entitled to receive compensation with respect to a loss from insurance or any other source be considered in determining the amount of restitution.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Upon determination of the amount of restitution owed to each victim, the court shall, pursuant to section 3572, specify in the restitution order the manner in which, and the schedule according to which, the restitution is to be paid, in consideration of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the financial resources and other assets of the defendant, including whether any of these assets are jointly controlled;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) projected earnings and other income of the defendant; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) any financial obligations of the defendant; including obligations to dependents.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) A restitution order may direct the defendant to make a single, lump-sum payment, partial payments at specified intervals, in-kind payments, or a combination of payments at specified intervals and in-kind payments.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:865 --><p class="statutory-body">(B) A restitution order may direct the defendant to make nominal periodic payments if the court finds from facts on the record that the economic circumstances of the defendant do not allow the payment of any amount of a restitution order, and do not allow for the payment of the full amount of a restitution order in the foreseeable future under any reasonable schedule of payments.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) An in-kind payment described in paragraph (3) may be in the form of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) return of property;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) replacement of property; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) if the victim agrees, services rendered to the victim or a person or organization other than the victim.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(g)(1) No victim shall be required to participate in any phase of a restitution order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A victim may at any time assign the victim's interest in restitution payments to the Crime Victims Fund in the Treasury without in any way impairing the obligation of the defendant to make such payments.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) If the court finds that more than 1 defendant has contributed to the loss of a victim, the court may make each defendant liable for payment of the full amount of restitution or may apportion liability among the defendants to reflect the level of contribution to the victim's loss and economic circumstances of each defendant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) If the court finds that more than 1 victim has sustained a loss requiring restitution by a defendant, the court may provide for a different payment schedule for each victim based on the type and amount of each victim's loss and accounting for the economic circumstances of each victim. In any case in which the United States is a victim, the court shall ensure that all other victims receive full restitution before the United States receives any restitution.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j)(1) If a victim has received compensation from insurance or any other source with respect to a loss, the court shall order that restitution be paid to the person who provided or is obligated to provide the compensation, but the restitution order shall provide that all restitution of victims required by the order be paid to the victims before any restitution is paid to such a provider of compensation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any amount paid to a victim under an order of restitution shall be reduced by any amount later recovered as compensatory damages for the same loss by the victim in&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) any Federal civil proceeding; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) any State civil proceeding, to the extent provided by the law of the State.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(k) A restitution order shall provide that the defendant shall notify the court and the Attorney General of any material change in the defendant's economic circumstances that might affect the defendant's ability to pay restitution. The court may also accept notification of a material change in the defendant's economic circumstances from the United States or from the victim. The Attorney General shall certify to the court that the victim or victims owed restitution by the defendant have been notified of the change in circumstances. Upon receipt of the notification, the court may, on its own motion, or the motion of any party, including the victim, adjust the payment schedule, or require immediate payment in full, as the interests of justice require.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(l) A conviction of a defendant for an offense involving the act giving rise to an order of restitution shall estop the defendant from denying the essential allegations of that offense in any subsequent Federal civil proceeding or State civil proceeding, to the extent consistent with State law, brought by the victim.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(m)(1)(A)(i) An order of restitution may be enforced by the United States in the manner provided for in subchapter C of chapter 227 and subchapter B of chapter 229 of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) by all other available and reasonable means.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) At the request of a victim named in a restitution order, the clerk of the court shall issue an abstract of judgment certifying that a judgment has been entered in favor of such victim in the amount specified in the restitution order. Upon registering, recording, docketing, or indexing such abstract in accordance with the rules and requirements relating to judgments of the court of the State where the district court is located, the abstract of judgment shall be a lien on the property of the defendant located in such State in the same manner and to the same extent and under the same conditions as a judgment of a court of general jurisdiction in that State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An order of in-kind restitution in the form of services shall be enforced by the probation officer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(n) If a person obligated to provide restitution, or pay a fine, receives substantial resources from any source, including inheritance, settlement, or other judgment, during a period of incarceration, such person shall be required to apply the value of such resources to any restitution or fine still owed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(o) A sentence that imposes an order of restitution is a final judgment notwithstanding the fact that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) such a sentence can subsequently be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) corrected under Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and section 3742 of chapter 235 of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) appealed and modified under section 3742;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) amended under subsection (d)(5); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) adjusted under section 3664(k), 3572, or 3613A; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the defendant may be resentenced under section 3565 or 3614.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(p) Nothing in this section or sections 2248, 2259, 2264, 2327, 3663, and 3663A and arising out of the application of such sections, shall be construed to create a cause of action not otherwise authorized in favor of any person against the United States or any officer or employee of the United States.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Whenever, in any proceeding in court for the forfeiture, under the internal-revenue laws, of any vehicle or aircraft seized for a violation of the internal-revenue laws relating to liquors, such forfeiture is decreed, the court shall have exclusive jurisdiction to remit or mitigate the forfeiture.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:867 --><p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Conditions precedent to remission or mitigation</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body">In any such proceeding the court shall not allow the claim of any claimant for remission or mitigation unless and until he proves (1) that he has an interest in such vehicle or aircraft, as owner or otherwise, which he acquired in good faith, (2) that he had at no time any knowledge or reason to believe that it was being or would be used in the violation of laws of the United States or of any State relating to liquor, and (3) if it appears that the interest asserted by the claimant arises out of or is in any way subject to any contract or agreement under which any person having a record or reputation for violating laws of the United States or of any State relating to liquor has a right with respect to such vehicle or aircraft, that, before such claimant acquired his interest, or such other person acquired his right under such contract or agreement, whichever occurred later, the claimant, his officer or agent, was informed in answer to his inquiry, at the headquarters of the sheriff, chief of police, principal Federal internal-revenue officer engaged in the enforcement of the liquor laws, or other principal local or Federal law-enforcement officer of the locality in which such other person acquired his right under such contract or agreement, of the locality in which such other person then resided, and of each locality in which the claimant has made any other inquiry as to the character or financial standing of such other person, that such other person had no such record or reputation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Claimants first entitled to delivery</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon the request of any claimant whose claim for remission or mitigation is allowed and whose interest is first in the order of priority among such claims allowed in such proceeding and is of an amount in excess of, or equal to, the appraised value of such vehicle or aircraft, the court shall order its return to him; and, upon the joint request of any two or more claimants whose claims are allowed and whose interests are not subject to any prior or intervening interests claimed and allowed in such proceedings, and are of a total amount in excess of, or equal to, the appraised value of such vehicle or aircraft, the court shall order its return to such of the joint requesting claimants as is designated in such request. Such return shall be made only upon payment of all expenses incident to the seizure and forfeiture incurred by the United States. In all other cases the court shall order disposition of such vehicle or aircraft as provided in section 1306 of title 40, and if such disposition be by public sale, payment from the proceeds thereof, after satisfaction of all such expenses, of any such claim in its order of priority among the claims allowed in such proceedings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Delivery on bond pending trial</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body">In any proceeding in court for the forfeiture under the internal-revenue laws of any vehicle or aircraft seized for a violation of the internal-revenue laws relating to liquor, the court shall order delivery thereof to any claimant who shall establish his right to the immediate possession thereof, and shall execute, with one or more sureties approved by the court, and deliver to the court, a bond to the United States for the payment of a sum equal to the appraised value of such vehicle or aircraft. Such bond shall be conditioned to return such vehicle or aircraft at the time of the trial and to pay the difference between the appraised value of such vehicle or aircraft as of the time it shall have been so released on bond and the appraised value thereof as of the time of trial; and conditioned further that, if the vehicle or aircraft be not returned at the time of trial, the bond shall stand in lieu of, and be forfeited in the same manner as, such vehicle or aircraft. Notwithstanding this subsection or any other provisions of law relating to the delivery of possession on bond of vehicles or aircraft sought to be forfeited under the internal-revenue laws, the court may, in its discretion and upon good cause shown by the United States, refuse to order such delivery of possession.</p>

<p class="note-body">The word &quot;dismissing&quot; was substituted for &quot;sustaining a motion to dismiss&quot; in two places for conciseness and clarity, there being no difference in effect of <!-- PDFPage:872 -->a decision of dismissal whether made on motion or by the court sua sponte.</p>
<p class="note-body">Minor changes were made to conform to Rule 12 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The final sentence authorizing promulgation of rules is omitted as redundant.</p>

<p class="note-body"><b>1994</b>&mdash;Second par. Pub. L. 103&ndash;322 substituted &quot;order of a district court&quot; for &quot;order of a district courts&quot;.</p>
<p class="note-body"><b>1986</b>&mdash;Fifth par. Pub. L. 99&ndash;646 struck out fifth par. which read as follows: &quot;Pending the prosecution and determination of the appeal in the foregoing instances, the defendant shall be released in accordance with chapter 207 of this title.&quot;</p>
<p class="note-body"><b>1984</b>&mdash;First par. Pub. L. 98&ndash;473, &sect;1206, inserted &quot;or granting a new trial after verdict or judgment,&quot; after &quot;indictment or information&quot;.</p>
<p class="note-body">Third par. Pub. L. 98&ndash;473, &sect;205, inserted third par. relating to appeals from a decision or order, entered by a district court of the United States, granting the release of a person charged with or convicted of an offense, or denying a motion for revocation of, or modification of the conditions of, a decision or order granting release.</p>
<p class="note-body"><b>1971</b>&mdash;First par. Pub.

<p class="note-body">Second par. Pub. L. 91&ndash;644, &sect;14(a)(1), enacted provision for appeal to a court of appeals from decision or order of district court suppressing or excluding evidence or requiring the return of seized property in a criminal proceeding, not made after the defendant has been put in jeopardy and before the verdict or finding on an indictment or information, if the United States attorney certifies to the district court that the appeal is not taken for purpose of delay and that the evidence is a substantial proof of a fact material in the proceeding.</p>
<p class="note-body">Such first and second pars. superseded former first eight pars. Pars. one through four had provided for appeal from district courts to Supreme Court from decision or judgment setting aside, or dismissing any indictment or information, or any count thereof and from decision arresting judgment of conviction for insufficiency of indictment or information, where such decision or judgment was based upon invalidity or construction of the statute upon which the indictment or information was founded and for an appeal from decision or judgment sustaining a motion in bar, where defendant had not been put in jeopardy. Pars. five through eight provided for appeal from district courts to a court of appeals where there were no provisions for direct appeal to Supreme Court from decision or judgment setting aside, or dismissing any indictment or information, or any count thereof and from decision arresting a judgment of conviction, and from an order, granting a motion for return of seized property or a motion to suppress evidence, made before trial of a person charged with violation of a Federal law, if the United States attorney certified to the judge who granted the motion that the appeal was not taken for purpose of delay and that the evidence was a substantial proof of the charge pending against the defendant.</p>
<p class="note-body">Third par. Pub. L. 91&ndash;644, &sect;14(a)(2), authorized within third par., formerly ninth, an appeal within thirty days after order has been rendered.</p>
<p class="note-body">Fourth par. Pub. L. 91&ndash;644, &sect;14(a), in revising the provisions, had the effect of designating former tenth par. as fourth par.</p>
<p class="note-body">Fifth par. Pub.

<p class="note-body"><b>1968</b>&mdash;Pub.

<p class="note-body"><b>1949</b>&mdash;Act May 24, 1949, substituted &quot;invalidity&quot; for &quot;validity&quot; after &quot;upon the&quot; in second par., and conformed language of fifth, tenth, and eleventh pars. to the changed nomenclature of the courts.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The reasonable right to confer with the attorney for the Government in the case.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Rights Afforded</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In any court proceeding involving an offense against a crime victim, the court shall ensure that the crime victim is afforded the rights described in subsection (a). Before making a determination described in subsection (a)(3), the court shall make every effort to permit the fullest attendance possible by the victim and shall consider reasonable alternatives to the exclusion of the victim from the criminal proceeding. The reasons for any decision denying relief under this chapter shall be clearly stated on the record.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Habeas corpus proceedings.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In a Federal habeas corpus proceeding arising out of a State conviction, the court shall ensure that a crime victim is afforded the rights described in paragraphs (3), (4), (7), and (8) of subsection (a).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Enforcement.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;These rights may be enforced by the crime victim or the crime victim's lawful representative in the manner described in paragraphs (1) and (3) of subsection (d).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) <cap-smallcap>Multiple victims</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In a case involving multiple victims, subsection (d)(2) shall also apply.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) <cap-smallcap>Limitation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;This paragraph relates to the duties of a court in relation to the rights of a crime victim in Federal habeas corpus proceedings arising out of a State conviction, and does not give rise to any obligation or requirement applicable to personnel of any agency of the Executive Branch of the Federal Government.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) <cap-smallcap>Definition</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For purposes of this paragraph, the term &quot;crime victim&quot; means the person against whom the State offense is committed or, if that person is killed or incapacitated, that person's family member or other lawful representative.</p>

A person accused of the crime may not obtain any form of relief under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Multiple crime victims</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In a case where the court finds that the number of crime victims makes it impracticable to accord all of the crime victims the rights described in subsection (a), the court shall fashion a reasonable procedure to give effect to this chapter that does not unduly complicate or prolong the proceedings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Motion for relief and writ of mandamus</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The rights described in subsection (a) shall be asserted in the district court in which a defendant is being prosecuted for the crime or, if no prosecution is underway, in the district court in the district in which the crime occurred.

If the district court denies the relief sought, the movant may petition the court of appeals for a writ of mandamus. The court of appeals may issue the writ on the order of a single judge pursuant to circuit rule or the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. The court of appeals shall take up and decide such application forthwith within 72 hours after the petition has been filed, unless the litigants, with the approval of the court, have stipulated to a different time period for consideration. In deciding such application, the court of appeals shall apply ordinary standards of appellate review.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Error</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In any appeal in a criminal case, the Government may assert as error the district court's denial of any crime victim's right in the proceeding to which the appeal relates.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) <cap-smallcap>Limitation on relief</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In no case shall a failure to afford a right under this chapter provide grounds for a new trial. A victim may make a motion to re-open a plea or sentence only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the victim has asserted the right to be heard before or during the proceeding at issue and such right was denied;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the victim petitions the court of appeals for a writ of mandamus within 14 days; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) in the case of a plea, the accused has not pled to the highest offense charged.</p>
