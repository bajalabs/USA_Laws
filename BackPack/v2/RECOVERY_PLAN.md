## Recovery Options

### Option 1: Smart Resume (RECOMMENDED)
```python
# Resume with remaining titles only
remaining_titles = [7, 15, 16, 22, 25, 29, 30, 33, 37, 44, 48, 50]

# Process in manageable batches
batch1 = [29, 30, 37, 44, 48]  # Medium titles (~126 chapters)
batch2 = [25, 33, 50]          # Large titles (~176 chapters) 
batch3 = [7, 15, 16, 22]       # Massive titles (~557 chapters)
```

### Option 2: Verification + Resume
```python
# First verify all completed titles have all expected files
# Then resume with remaining titles
```

### Option 3: Complete Fresh Start
```python
# Start over with all 29 titles (NOT RECOMMENDED - wastes completed work)
```

## Recommended Recovery Plan

### Phase 1: Verification (5 minutes)
1. **Quick verification** of completed titles
2. **Check file counts** in each completed title
3. **Identify any incomplete titles** that need re-processing

### Phase 2: Resume Processing (30-45 minutes)
1. **Batch 1**: Medium remaining titles (29, 30, 37, 44, 48)
2. **Batch 2**: Large remaining titles (25, 33, 50)  
3. **Batch 3**: Massive remaining titles (7, 15, 16, 22)

### Phase 3: Final Validation
1. **Complete file count verification**
2. **Generate final index**
3. **Create completion report**

## Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Completed titles are intact
- **Medium Risk**: Some large titles may timeout
- **Mitigation**: Process largest titles individually

## Success Metrics
- **Current**: 18/29 titles (62% complete)
- **Target**: 29/29 titles (100% complete)
- **Estimated Time**: 30-60 minutes for remaining work

## Recommendation
**Proceed with Option 1 (Smart Resume)** - most efficient approach that preserves completed work and continues from where we left off.
