<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(3) terrorist involvement in illicit cigarette trafficking will continue to grow because of the large profits such organizations can earn;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(4) the sale of illegal cigarettes and smokeless tobacco over the Internet, and through mail, fax, or phone orders, makes it cheaper and easier for children to obtain tobacco products;</p>

<p class="note-body">&quot;(c) <cap-smallcap>Purposes</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the purpose of this Act [see Short Title of 2010 Amendment note above] to&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(1) require Internet and other remote sellers of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco to comply with the same laws that apply to law-abiding tobacco retailers;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(2) create strong disincentives to illegal smuggling of tobacco products;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(3) provide government enforcement officials with more effective enforcement tools to combat tobacco smuggling;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(4) make it more difficult for cigarette and smokeless tobacco traffickers to engage in and profit from their illegal activities;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(5) increase collections of Federal, State, and local excise taxes on cigarettes and smokeless tobacco; and</p>
