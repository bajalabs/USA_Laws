<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Informed use of credit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that economic stabilization would be enhanced and the competition among the various financial institutions and other firms engaged in the extension of consumer credit would be strengthened by the informed use of credit. The informed use of credit results from an awareness of the cost thereof by consumers. It is the purpose of this subchapter to assure a meaningful disclosure of credit terms so that the consumer will be able to compare more readily the various credit terms available to him and avoid the uninformed use of credit, and to protect the consumer against inaccurate and unfair credit billing and credit card practices.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Terms of personal property leases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress also finds that there has been a recent trend toward leasing automobiles and other durable goods for consumer use as an alternative to installment credit sales and that these leases have been offered without adequate cost disclosures. It is the purpose of this subchapter to assure a meaningful disclosure of the terms of leases of personal property for personal, family, or household purposes so as to enable the lessee to compare more readily the various lease terms available to him, limit balloon payments in consumer leasing, enable comparison of lease terms with credit terms where appropriate, and to assure meaningful and accurate disclosures of lease terms in advertisements.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Bureau shall prescribe regulations to carry out the purposes of this subchapter. Except with respect to the provisions of section 1639 of this title that apply to a mortgage referred to in section 1602(aa)&#160;<sup><a href="#1604_1_target" name="1604_1">1</a></sup> of this title, such regulations may contain such additional requirements, classifications, differentiations, or other provisions, and may provide for such adjustments and exceptions for all or any class of transactions, as in the judgment of the Bureau are necessary or proper to effectuate the purposes of this subchapter, to prevent circumvention or evasion thereof, or to facilitate compliance therewith.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Model disclosure forms and clauses; publication, criteria, compliance, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Bureau shall publish a single, integrated disclosure for mortgage loan transactions (including real estate settlement cost statements) which includes the disclosure requirements of this subchapter in conjunction with the disclosure requirements of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974 [12 U.S.C. 2601 et seq.] that, taken together, may apply to a transaction that is subject to both or either provisions of law. The purpose of such model disclosure shall be to facilitate compliance with the disclosure requirements of this subchapter and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974, and to aid the borrower or lessee in understanding the transaction by utilizing readily understandable language to simplify the technical nature of the disclosures. In devising such forms, the Bureau shall consider the use by creditors or lessors of data processing or similar automated equipment. Nothing in this subchapter may be construed to require a creditor or lessor to use any such model form or clause prescribed by the Bureau under this section. A creditor or lessor shall be deemed to be in compliance with the disclosure provisions of this subchapter with respect to other than numerical disclosures if the creditor or lessor (1) uses any appropriate model form or clause as published by the Bureau, or (2) uses any such model form or clause and changes it by (A) deleting any information which is not required by this subchapter, or (B) rearranging the format, if in making such deletion or rearranging the format, the creditor or lessor does not affect the substance, clarity, or meaningful sequence of the disclosure.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Procedures applicable for adoption of model forms and clauses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Model disclosure forms and clauses shall be adopted by the Bureau after notice duly given in the Federal Register and an opportunity for public comment in accordance with section 553 of title 5.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Effective dates of regulations containing new disclosure requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any regulation of the Bureau, or any amendment or interpretation thereof, requiring any disclosure which differs from the disclosures previously required by this part, part D, or part E or by any regulation of the Bureau promulgated thereunder shall have an effective date of that October 1 which follows by at least six months the date of promulgation, except that the Bureau may at its discretion take interim action by regulation, amendment, or interpretation to lengthen the period of time permitted for creditors or lessors to adjust their forms to accommodate new requirements or shorten the length of time for creditors or lessors to make such adjustments when it makes a specific finding that such action is necessary to comply with the findings of a court or to prevent unfair or deceptive disclosure practices. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, any creditor or lessor may comply with any such newly promulgated disclosure requirements prior to the effective date of the requirements.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Disclosure for charitable mortgage loan transactions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">With respect to a mortgage loan transaction involving a residential mortgage loan offered at 0 percent interest with only bonafide and reasonable fees and that is primarily for charitable purposes by an organization described in section 501(c)(3) of title 26 and exempt from taxation under section 501(a) of such title, forms HUD&ndash;1 and GFE (as defined under section 1024.2(b) of title 12, Code of Federal Regulations) together with a disclosure substantially in the form of the Loan Model Form H&ndash;2 (as depicted in Appendix H to part 1026 of title 12, Code of Federal Regulations) shall, collectively, be an appropriate model form for purposes of subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Exemption authority</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Bureau may exempt, by regulation, from all or part of this subchapter all or any class of transactions, other than transactions involving any mortgage described in section 1602(aa)&#160;<sup><a href="#1604_1_target" name="1604_1">1</a></sup> of this title, for which, in the determination of the Bureau, coverage under all or part of this subchapter does not provide a meaningful benefit to consumers in the form of useful information or protection.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1464 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Factors for consideration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In determining which classes of transactions to exempt in whole or in part under paragraph (1), the Bureau shall consider the following factors and publish its rationale at the time a proposed exemption is published for comment:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The amount of the loan and whether the disclosures, right of rescission, and other provisions provide a benefit to the consumers who are parties to such transactions, as determined by the Bureau.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The extent to which the requirements of this subchapter complicate, hinder, or make more expensive the credit process for the class of transactions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) The status of the borrower, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) any related financial arrangements of the borrower, as determined by the Bureau;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the financial sophistication of the borrower relative to the type of transaction; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the importance to the borrower of the credit, related supporting property, and coverage under this subchapter, as determined by the Bureau;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) whether the loan is secured by the principal residence of the consumer; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) whether the goal of consumer protection would be undermined by such an exemption.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Waiver for certain borrowers</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Bureau, by regulation, may exempt from the requirements of this subchapter certain credit transactions if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the transaction involves a consumer&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) with an annual earned income of more than $200,000; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) having net assets in excess of $1,000,000 at the time of the transaction; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a waiver that is handwritten, signed, and dated by the consumer is first obtained from the consumer.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Adjustments by the Bureau</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Bureau, at its discretion, may adjust the annual earned income and net asset requirements of paragraph (1) for inflation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Deference</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any power granted to any Federal agency under this subchapter, the deference that a court affords to the Bureau with respect to a determination made by the Bureau relating to the meaning or interpretation of any provision of this subchapter, other than section 1639e or 1639h of this title, shall be applied as if the Bureau were the only agency authorized to apply, enforce, interpret, or administer the provisions of this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Authority of the Board to prescribe rules</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding subsection (a), the Board shall have authority to prescribe rules under this subchapter with respect to a person described in section 5519(a) of title 12. Regulations prescribed under this subsection may contain such classifications, differentiations, or other provisions, as in the judgment of the Board are necessary or proper to effectuate the purposes of this subchapter, to prevent circumvention or evasion thereof, or to facilitate compliance therewith.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) &quot;Finance charge&quot; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as otherwise provided in this section, the amount of the finance charge in connection with any consumer credit transaction shall be determined as the sum of all charges, payable directly or indirectly by the person to whom the credit is extended, and imposed directly or indirectly by the creditor as an incident to the extension of credit. The finance charge does not include charges of a type payable in a comparable cash transaction. The finance charge shall not include fees and amounts imposed by third party closing agents (including settlement agents, attorneys, and escrow and title companies) if the creditor does not require the imposition of the charges or the services provided and does not retain the charges. Examples of charges which are included in the finance charge include any of the following types of charges which are applicable:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Interest, time price differential, and any amount payable under a point, discount, or other system or additional charges.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Charges or premiums for credit life, accident, or health insurance written in connection with any consumer credit transaction shall be included in the finance charges unless</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the coverage of the debtor by the insurance is not a factor in the approval by the creditor of the extension of credit, and this fact is clearly disclosed in writing to the person applying for or obtaining the extension of credit; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in order to obtain the insurance in connection with the extension of credit, the person to whom the credit is extended must give specific affirmative written indication of his desire to do so after written disclosure to him of the cost thereof.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Property damage and liability insurance premiums included in finance charge</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Charges or premiums for insurance, written in connection with any consumer credit transaction, against loss of or damage to property or against liability arising out of the ownership or use of property, shall be included in the finance charge unless a clear and specific statement in writing is furnished by the creditor to the person to whom the credit is extended, setting forth the cost of the insurance if obtained from or through the creditor, and stating that the person to whom the credit is extended may choose the person through which the insurance is to be obtained.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Items exempted from computation of finance charge in all credit transactions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If any of the following items is itemized and disclosed in accordance with the regulations of the Bureau in connection with any transaction, then the creditor need not include that item in the computation of the finance charge with respect to that transaction:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Fees and charges prescribed by law which actually are or will be paid to public officials for determining the existence of or for perfecting or releasing or satisfying any security related to the credit transaction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The premium payable for any insurance in lieu of perfecting any security interest otherwise required by the creditor in connection with the transaction, if the premium does not exceed the fees and charges described in paragraph (1) which would otherwise be payable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Any tax levied on security instruments or on documents evidencing indebtedness if the payment of such taxes is a precondition for recording the instrument securing the evidence of indebtedness.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Items exempted from computation of finance charge in extensions of credit secured by an interest in real property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The following items, when charged in connection with any extension of credit secured by an interest in real property, shall not be included in the computation of the finance charge with respect to that transaction:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Fees or premiums for title examination, title insurance, or similar purposes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Fees for preparation of loan-related documents.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Escrows for future payments of taxes and insurance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Fees for notarizing deeds and other documents.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Appraisal fees, including fees related to any pest infestation or flood hazard inspections conducted prior to closing.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Tolerances for accuracy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In connection with credit transactions not under an open end credit plan that are secured <!-- PDFPage:1466 -->by real property or a dwelling, the disclosure of the finance charge and other disclosures affected by any finance charge&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) shall be treated as being accurate for purposes of this subchapter if the amount disclosed as the finance charge&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) does not vary from the actual finance charge by more than $100; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in the case of a transaction, other than a mortgage referred to in section 1602(aa)&#160;<sup><a href="#1605_1_target" name="1605_1">1</a></sup> of this title, which&mdash;</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1606. Determination of annual percentage rate</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) &quot;Annual percentage rate&quot; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The annual percentage rate applicable to any extension of consumer credit shall be determined, in accordance with the regulations of the Bureau,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in the case of any extension of credit other than under an open end credit plan, as</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) that nominal annual percentage rate which will yield a sum equal to the amount of the finance charge when it is applied to the unpaid balances of the amount financed, calculated according to the actuarial method of allocating payments made on a debt between the amount financed and the amount of the finance charge, pursuant to which a payment is applied first to the accumulated finance charge and the balance is applied to the unpaid amount financed; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the rate determined by any method prescribed by the Bureau as a method which materially simplifies computation while retaining reasonable accuracy as compared with the rate determined under subparagraph (A).<sup><a href="#1606_1_target" name="1606_1">1</a></sup></p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in the case of any extension of credit under an open end credit plan, as the quotient (expressed as a percentage) of the total finance charge for the period to which it relates divided by the amount upon which the finance charge for that period is based, multiplied by the number of such periods in a year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Computation of rate of finance charges for balances within a specified range</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Where a creditor imposes the same finance charge for balances within a specified range, the annual percentage rate shall be computed on the median balance within the range, except that if the Bureau determines that a rate so computed would not be meaningful, or would be materially misleading, the annual percentage rate shall be computed on such other basis as the Bureau may be regulation require.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Allowable tolerances for purposes of compliance with disclosure requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The disclosure of an annual percentage rate is accurate for the purpose of this subchapter if the rate disclosed is within a tolerance not greater than one-eighth of 1 per centum more or less than the actual rate or rounded to the nearest one-fourth of 1 per centum. The Bureau may allow a greater tolerance to simplify compliance where irregular payments are involved.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Use of rate tables or charts having allowable variance from determined rates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Bureau may authorize the use of rate tables or charts which may provide for the disclosure of annual percentage rates which vary from the rate determined in accordance with subsection (a)(1)(A) by not more than such tolerances as the Bureau may allow. The Bureau may not allow a tolerance greater than 8 per centum of that rate except to simplify compliance where irregular payments are involved.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Authorization of tolerances in determining annual percentage rates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of creditors determining the annual percentage rate in a manner other than as described in subsection (d), the Bureau may authorize other reasonable tolerances.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Rules and regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The authority of the Bureau to issue regulations under this subchapter does not impair the authority of any other agency designated in this section to make rules respecting its own procedures in enforcing compliance with requirements imposed under this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Adjustment of finance charges; procedures applicable, coverage, criteria, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In carrying out its enforcement activities under this section, each agency referred to in subsection (a) or (c), in cases where an annual percentage rate or finance charge was inaccurately disclosed, shall notify the creditor of such disclosure error and is authorized in accordance with the provisions of this subsection to require the creditor to make an adjustment to the account of the person to whom credit was extended, to assure that such person will not be required to pay a finance charge in excess of the finance charge actually disclosed or the dollar equivalent of the annual percentage rate actually disclosed, whichever is lower. For the purposes of this subsection, except where such disclosure error resulted from a willful violation which was intended to mislead the person to whom credit was extended, in determining whether a disclosure error has occurred and in calculating any adjustment, (A) each agency shall apply (i) with respect to the annual percentage rate, a tolerance of one-quarter of 1 percent more or less than the actual rate, determined without regard to section 1606(c) of this title, and (ii) with respect to the finance charge, a corresponding numerical tolerance as generated by the tolerance provided under this subsection for the annual percentage rate; except that (B) with respect to transactions consummated after two years following March 31, 1980, each agency shall apply (i) for transactions that have a scheduled amortization of ten years or less, with respect to the annual percentage rate, a tolerance not to exceed one-quarter of 1 percent more or less than the actual rate, determined without regard to section 1606(c) of this title, but in no event a tolerance of less than the tolerances allowed under section 1606(c) of this title, (ii) for transactions that have a scheduled amortization of more than ten years, with respect to the annual percentage rate, only such tolerances as are allowed under section 1606(c) of this title, and (iii) for all transactions, with respect to the finance charge, a corresponding numerical tolerance as generated by the tolerances provided under this subsection for the annual percentage rate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Each agency shall require such an adjustment when it determines that such disclosure error resulted from (A) a clear and consistent pattern or practice of violations, (B) gross negligence, or (C) a willful violation which was intended to mislead the person to whom the credit <!-- PDFPage:1469 -->was extended. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, except where such disclosure error resulted from a willful violation which was intended to mislead the person to whom credit was extended, an agency need not require such an adjustment if it determines that such disclosure error&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) resulted from an error involving the disclosure of a fee or charge that would otherwise be excludable in computing the finance charge, including but not limited to violations involving the disclosures described in sections 1605(b), (c) and (d) of this title, in which event the agency may require such remedial action as it determines to be equitable, except that for transactions consummated after two years after March 31, 1980, such an adjustment shall be ordered for violations of section 1605(b) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) involved a disclosed amount which was 10 per centum or less of the amount that should have been disclosed and (i) in cases where the error involved a disclosed finance charge, the annual percentage rate was disclosed correctly, and (ii) in cases where the error involved a disclosed annual percentage rate, the finance charge was disclosed correctly; in which event the agency may require such adjustment as it determines to be equitable;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) involved a total failure to disclose either the annual percentage rate or the finance charge, in which event the agency may require such adjustment as it determines to be equitable; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) resulted from any other unique circumstance involving clearly technical and nonsubstantive disclosure violations that do not adversely affect information provided to the consumer and that have not misled or otherwise deceived the consumer.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">In the case of other such disclosure errors, each agency may require such an adjustment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Notwithstanding paragraph (2), no adjustment shall be ordered&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) if it would have a significantly adverse impact upon the safety or soundness of the creditor, but in any such case, the agency may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) require a partial adjustment in an amount which does not have such an impact; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) require the full adjustment, but permit the creditor to make the required adjustment in partial payments over an extended period of time which the agency considers to be reasonable, if (in the case of an agency referred to in paragraph (1), (2), or (3) of subsection (a)), the agency determines that a partial adjustment or making partial payments over an extended period is necessary to avoid causing the creditor to become undercapitalized pursuant to section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act [12 U.S.C. 1831o];</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the&#160;<sup><a href="#1607_1_target" name="1607_1">1</a></sup> amount of the adjustment would be less than $1, except that if more than one year has elapsed since the date of the violation, the agency may require that such amount be paid into the Treasury of the United States, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) except where such disclosure error resulted from a willful violation which was intended to mislead the person to whom credit was extended, in the case of an open-end credit plan, more than two years after the violation, or in the case of any other extension of credit, as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) with respect to creditors that are subject to examination by the agencies referred to in paragraphs (1) through (3) of subsection (a) of this section, except in connection with violations arising from practices identified in the current examination and only in connection with transactions that are consummated after the date of the immediately preceding examination, except that where practices giving rise to violations identified in earlier examinations have not been corrected, adjustments for those violations shall be required in connection with transactions consummated after the date of examination in which such practices were first identified;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) with respect to creditors that are not subject to examination by such agencies, except in connection with transactions that are consummated after May 10, 1978; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) in no event after the later of (I) the expiration of the life of the credit extension, or (II) two years after the agreement to extend credit was consummated.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, an adjustment under this subsection may be required by an agency referred to in subsection (a) or (c) only by an order issued in accordance with cease and desist procedures provided by the provision of law referred to in such subsections.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In case of an agency which is not authorized to conduct cease and desist proceedings, such an order may be issued after an agency hearing on the record conducted at least thirty but not more than sixty days after notice of the alleged violation is served on the creditor. Such a hearing shall be deemed to be a hearing which is subject to the provisions of section 8(h) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act [12 U.S.C. 1818(h)] and shall be subject to judicial review as provided therein.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Except as otherwise specifically provided in this subsection and notwithstanding any provision of law referred to in subsection (a) or (c), no agency referred to in subsection (a) or (c) may require a creditor to make dollar adjustments for errors in any requirements under this subchapter, except with regard to the requirements of section 1666d of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) A creditor shall not be subject to an order to make an adjustment, if within sixty days after discovering a disclosure error, whether pursuant to a final written examination report or through the creditor's own procedures, the creditor notifies the person concerned of the error and adjusts the account so as to assure that such person will not be required to pay a finance charge in excess of the finance charge actually disclosed or the dollar equivalent of the annual percentage rate actually disclosed, whichever is lower.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) Notwithstanding the second sentence of subsection (e)(1), subsection (e)(3)(C)(i), and sub<!-- PDFPage:1470 -->section (e)(3)(C)(ii), each agency referred to in subsection (a) or (c) shall require an adjustment for an annual percentage rate disclosure error that exceeds a tolerance of one quarter of one percent less than the actual rate, determined without regard to section 1606(c) of this title, with respect to any transaction consummated between January 1, 1977, and March 31, 1980.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in subsection (e), this part and parts B and C, do not annul, alter, or affect the laws of any State relating to the disclosure of information in connection with credit transactions, except to the extent that those laws are inconsistent with the provisions of this subchapter, and then only to the extent of the inconsistency. Upon its own motion or upon the request of any creditor, State, or other interested party which is submitted in accordance with procedures prescribed in regulations of the Bureau, the Bureau shall determine whether any such inconsistency exists. If the Bureau determines that a State-required disclosure is inconsistent, creditors located in that State may not make disclosures using the inconsistent term or form, and shall incur no liability under the law of that State for failure to use such term or form, notwithstanding that such determination is subsequently amended, rescinded, or determined by judicial or other authority to be invalid for any reason.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Upon its own motion or upon the request of any creditor, State, or other interested party which is submitted in accordance with procedures prescribed in regulations of the Bureau, the Bureau shall determine whether any disclosure required under the law of any State is substantially the same in meaning as a disclosure required under this subchapter. If the Bureau determines that a State-required disclosure is substantially the same in meaning as a disclosure required by this subchapter, then creditors located in that State may make such disclosure in compliance with such State law in lieu of the disclosure required by this subchapter, except that the annual percentage rate and finance charge shall be disclosed as required by section 1632 of this title, and such State-required disclosure may not be made in lieu of the disclosures <!-- PDFPage:1472 -->applicable to certain mortgages under section 1639 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) State credit charge statutes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in section 1639 of this title, this subchapter does not otherwise annul, alter or affect in any manner the meaning, scope or applicability of the laws of any State, including, but not limited to, laws relating to the types, amounts or rates of charges, or any element or elements of charges, permissible under such laws in connection with the extension or use of credit, nor does this subchapter extend the applicability of those laws to any class of persons or transactions to which they would not otherwise apply. The provisions of section 1639 of this title do not annul, alter, or affect the applicability of the laws of any State or exempt any person subject to the provisions of section 1639 of this title from complying with the laws of any State, with respect to the requirements for mortgages referred to in section 1602(aa)&#160;<sup><a href="#1610_1_target" name="1610_1">1</a></sup> of this title, except to the extent that those State laws are inconsistent with any provisions of section 1639 of this title, and then only to the extent of the inconsistency.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Disclosure as evidence</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any action or proceeding in any court involving a consumer credit sale, the disclosure of the annual percentage rate as required under this subchapter in connection with that sale may not be received as evidence that the sale was a loan or any type of transaction other than a credit sale.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Contract or other obligations under State or Federal law</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as specified in sections 1635, 1640, and 1666e of this title, this subchapter and the regulations issued thereunder do not affect the validity or enforceability of any contract or obligation under State or Federal law.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">If a transaction involves one creditor as defined in section 1602(f)&#160;<sup><a href="#1631_1_target" name="1631_1">1</a></sup> of this title, or one lessor as defined in section 1667(3) of this title, such creditor or lessor shall make the disclosures. If a transaction involves more than one creditor or lessor, only one creditor or lessor shall by required to make the disclosures. The Bureau shall by regulation specify which creditor or lessor shall make the disclosures.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Estimates as satisfying statutory requirements; basis of disclosure for per diem interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Bureau may provide by regulation that any portion of the information required to be disclosed by this subchapter may be given in the form of estimates where the provider of such information is not in a position to know exact information. In the case of any consumer credit transaction a portion of the interest on which is determined on a per diem basis and is to be collected upon the consummation of such transaction, any disclosure with respect to such portion of interest shall be deemed to be accurate for purposes of this subchapter if the disclosure is based on information actually known to the creditor at the time that the disclosure documents are being prepared for the consummation of the transaction.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Tolerances for numerical disclosures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Bureau shall determine whether tolerances for numerical disclosures other than the annual percentage rate are necessary to facilitate compliance with this subchapter, and if it determines that such tolerances are necessary to facilitate compliance, it shall by regulation permit disclosures within such tolerances. The Bureau shall exercise its authority to permit tolerances for numerical disclosures other than the annual percentage rate so that such tolerances are narrow enough to prevent such tolerances from resulting in misleading disclosures or disclosures that circumvent the purposes of this subchapter.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Disclosure of obligor's right to rescind</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as otherwise provided in this section, in the case of any consumer credit transaction (including opening or increasing the credit limit for an open end credit plan) in which a security interest, including any such interest arising by operation of law, is or will be retained or acquired in any property which is used as the principal dwelling of the person to whom credit is extended, the obligor shall have the right to rescind the transaction until midnight of the third business day following the consummation of the transaction or the delivery of the information and rescission forms required under this section together with a statement containing the material disclosures required under this subchapter, whichever is later, by notifying the creditor, in accordance with regulations of the Bureau, of his intention to do so. The creditor shall clearly and conspicuously disclose, in accordance with regulations of the Bureau, to any obligor in a transaction subject to this section the rights of the obligor under this section. The creditor shall also provide, in accordance with regulations of the Bureau, appropriate forms for the obligor to exercise his right to rescind any transaction subject to this section.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1479 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Return of money or property following rescission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When an obligor exercises his right to rescind under subsection (a), he is not liable for any finance or other charge, and any security interest given by the obligor, including any such interest arising by operation of law, becomes void upon such a rescission. Within 20 days after receipt of a notice of rescission, the creditor shall return to the obligor any money or property given as earnest money, downpayment, or otherwise, and shall take any action necessary or appropriate to reflect the termination of any security interest created under the transaction. If the creditor has delivered any property to the obligor, the obligor may retain possession of it. Upon the performance of the creditor's obligations under this section, the obligor shall tender the property to the creditor, except that if return of the property in kind would be impracticable or inequitable, the obligor shall tender its reasonable value. Tender shall be made at the location of the property or at the residence of the obligor, at the option of the obligor. If the creditor does not take possession of the property within 20 days after tender by the obligor, ownership of the property vests in the obligor without obligation on his part to pay for it. The procedures prescribed by this subsection shall apply except when otherwise ordered by a court.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Rebuttable presumption of delivery of required disclosures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any rule of evidence, written acknowledgment of receipt of any disclosures required under this subchapter by a person to whom information, forms, and a statement is required to be given pursuant to this section does no more than create a rebuttable presumption of delivery thereof.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Modification and waiver of rights</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Bureau may, if it finds that such action is necessary in order to permit homeowners to meet bona fide personal financial emergencies, prescribe regulations authorizing the modification or waiver of any rights created under this section to the extent and under the circumstances set forth in those regulations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Exempted transactions; reapplication of provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This section does not apply to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a residential mortgage transaction as defined in section 1602(w)&#160;<sup><a href="#1635_1_target" name="1635_1">1</a></sup> of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a transaction which constitutes a refinancing or consolidation (with no new advances) of the principal balance then due and any accrued and unpaid finance charges of an existing extension of credit by the same creditor secured by an interest in the same property;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) a transaction in which an agency of a State is the creditor; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) advances under a preexisting open end credit plan if a security interest has already been retained or acquired and such advances are in accordance with a previously established credit limit for such plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Time limit for exercise of right</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An obligor's right of rescission shall expire three years after the date of consummation of the transaction or upon the sale of the property, whichever occurs first, notwithstanding the fact that the information and forms required under this section or any other disclosures required under this part have not been delivered to the obligor, except that if (1) any agency empowered to enforce the provisions of this subchapter institutes a proceeding to enforce the provisions of this section within three years after the date of consummation of the transaction, (2) such agency finds a violation of this section, and (3) the obligor's right to rescind is based in whole or in part on any matter involved in such proceeding, then the obligor's right of rescission shall expire three years after the date of consummation of the transaction or upon the earlier sale of the property, or upon the expiration of one year following the conclusion of the proceeding, or any judicial review or period for judicial review thereof, whichever is later.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Additional relief</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any action in which it is determined that a creditor has violated this section, in addition to rescission the court may award relief under section 1640 of this title for violations of this subchapter not relating to the right to rescind.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Limitation on rescission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An obligor shall have no rescission rights arising solely from the form of written notice used by the creditor to inform the obligor of the rights of the obligor under this section, if the creditor provided the obligor the appropriate form of written notice published and adopted by the Bureau, or a comparable written notice of the rights of the obligor, that was properly completed by the creditor, and otherwise complied with all other requirements of this section regarding notice.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Rescission rights in foreclosure</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding section 1649 of this title, and subject to the time period provided in subsection (f), in addition to any other right of rescission available under this section for a transaction, after the initiation of any judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure process on the primary dwelling of an obligor securing an extension of credit, the obligor shall have a right to rescind the transaction equivalent to other rescission rights provided by this section, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a mortgage broker fee is not included in the finance charge in accordance with the laws and regulations in effect at the time the consumer credit transaction was consummated; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the form of notice of rescission for the transaction is not the appropriate form of written notice published and adopted by the Bureau or a comparable written notice, and otherwise complied with all the requirements of this section regarding notice.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Tolerance for disclosures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding section 1605(f) of this title, and subject to the time period provided in subsection (f), for the purposes of exercising any <!-- PDFPage:1480 -->rescission rights after the initiation of any judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure process on the principal dwelling of the obligor securing an extension of credit, the disclosure of the finance charge and other disclosures affected by any finance charge shall be treated as being accurate for purposes of this section if the amount disclosed as the finance charge does not vary from the actual finance charge by more than $35 or is greater than the amount required to be disclosed under this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Right of recoupment under State law</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this subsection affects a consumer's right of rescission in recoupment under State law.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Applicability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">This subsection shall apply to all consumer credit transactions in existence or consummated on or after September 30, 1995.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Required disclosures by creditor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Before opening any account under an open end consumer credit plan, the creditor shall disclose to the person to whom credit is to be extended each of the following items, to the extent applicable:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The conditions under which a finance charge may be imposed, including the time period (if any) within which any credit extended may be repaid without incurring a finance charge, except that the creditor may, at his election and without disclosure, impose no such finance charge if payment is received after the termination of such time period. If no such time period is provided, the creditor shall disclose such fact.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1481 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The method of determining the balance upon which a finance charge will be imposed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The method of determining the amount of the finance charge, including any minimum or fixed amount imposed as a finance charge.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Where one or more periodic rates may be used to compute the finance charge, each such rate, the range of balances to which it is applicable, and the corresponding nominal annual percentage rate determined by multiplying the periodic rate by the number of periods in a year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Identification of other charges which may be imposed as part of the plan, and their method of computation, in accordance with regulations of the Bureau.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) In cases where the credit is or will be secured, a statement that a security interest has been or will be taken in (A) the property purchased as part of the credit transaction, or (B) property not purchased as part of the credit transaction identified by item or type.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) A statement, in a form prescribed by regulations of the Bureau of the protection provided by sections 1666 and 1666i of this title to an obligor and the creditor's responsibilities under sections 1666a and 1666i of this title. With respect to one billing cycle per calendar year, at intervals of not less than six months or more than eighteen months, the creditor shall transmit such statement to each obligor to whom the creditor is required to transmit a statement pursuant to subsection (b) for such billing cycle.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) In the case of any account under an open end consumer credit plan which provides for any extension of credit which is secured by the consumer's principal dwelling, any information which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is required to be disclosed under section 1637a(a) of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the Bureau determines is not described in any other paragraph of this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Statement required with each billing cycle</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The creditor of any account under an open end consumer credit plan shall transmit to the obligor, for each billing cycle at the end of which there is an outstanding balance in that account or with respect to which a finance charge is imposed, a statement setting forth each of the following items to the extent applicable:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The outstanding balance in the account at the beginning of the statement period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The amount and date of each extension of credit during the period, and a brief identification, on or accompanying the statement of each extension of credit in a form prescribed by the Bureau sufficient to enable the obligor either to identify the transaction or to relate it to copies of sales vouchers or similar instruments previously furnished, except that a creditor's failure to disclose such information in accordance with this paragraph shall not be deemed a failure to comply with this part or this subchapter if (A) the creditor maintains procedures reasonably adapted to procure and provide such information, and (B) the creditor responds to and treats any inquiry for clarification or documentation as a billing error and an erroneously billed amount under section 1666 of this title. In lieu of complying with the requirements of the previous sentence, in the case of any transaction in which the creditor and seller are the same person, as defined by the Bureau, and such person's open end credit plan has fewer than 15,000 accounts, the creditor may elect to provide only the amount and date of each extension of credit during the period and the seller's name and location where the transaction took place if (A) a brief identification of the transaction has been previously furnished, and (B) the creditor responds to and treats any inquiry for clarification or documentation as a billing error and an erroneously billed amount under section 1666 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The total amount credited to the account during the period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The amount of any finance charge added to the account during the period, itemized to show the amounts, if any, due to the application of percentage rates and the amount, if any, imposed as a minimum or fixed charge.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Where one or more periodic rates may be used to compute the finance charge, each such rate, the range of balances to which it is applicable, and, unless the annual percentage rate (determined under section 1606(a)(2) of this title) is required to be disclosed pursuant to paragraph (6), the corresponding nominal annual percentage rate determined by multiplying the periodic rate by the number of periods in a year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Where the total finance charge exceeds 50 cents for a monthly or longer billing cycle, or the pro rata part of 50 cents for a billing cycle shorter than monthly, the total finance charge expressed as an annual percentage rate (determined under section 1606(a)(2) of this title), except that if the finance charge is the sum of two or more products of a rate times a portion of the balance, the creditor may, in lieu of disclosing a single rate for the total charge, disclose each such rate expressed as an annual percentage rate, and the part of the balance to which it is applicable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) The balance on which the finance charge was computed and a statement of how the balance was determined. If the balance is determined without first deducting all credits during the period, that fact and the amount of such payments shall also be disclosed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) The outstanding balance in the account at the end of the period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) The date by which or the period (if any) within which, payment must be made to avoid additional finance charges, except that the creditor may, at his election and without disclosure, impose no such additional finance charge if payment is received after such date or the termination of such period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) The address to be used by the creditor for the purpose of receiving billing inquiries from the obligor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11)(A) A written statement in the following form: &quot;Minimum Payment Warning: Making only the minimum payment will increase the amount of interest you pay and the time it takes to repay your balance.&quot;, or such similar statement as is established by the Bureau pursuant to consumer testing.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1482 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Repayment information that would apply to the outstanding balance of the consumer under the credit plan, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the number of months (rounded to the nearest month) that it would take to pay the entire amount of that balance, if the consumer pays only the required minimum monthly payments and if no further advances are made;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the total cost to the consumer, including interest and principal payments, of paying that balance in full, if the consumer pays only the required minimum monthly payments and if no further advances are made;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) the monthly payment amount that would be required for the consumer to eliminate the outstanding balance in 36 months, if no further advances are made, and the total cost to the consumer, including interest and principal payments, of paying that balance in full if the consumer pays the balance over 36 months; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) a toll-free telephone number at which the consumer may receive information about accessing credit counseling and debt management services.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C)(i) Subject to clause (ii), in making the disclosures under subparagraph (B), the creditor shall apply the interest rate or rates in effect on the date on which the disclosure is made until the date on which the balance would be paid in full.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) If the interest rate in effect on the date on which the disclosure is made is a temporary rate that will change under a contractual provision applying an index or formula for subsequent interest rate adjustment, the creditor shall apply the interest rate in effect on the date on which the disclosure is made for as long as that interest rate will apply under that contractual provision, and then apply an interest rate based on the index or formula in effect on the applicable billing date.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) All of the information described in subparagraph (B) shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) be disclosed in the form and manner which the Bureau shall prescribe, by regulation, and in a manner that avoids duplication; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) be placed in a conspicuous and prominent location on the billing statement.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) In the regulations prescribed under subparagraph (D), the Bureau shall require that the disclosure of such information shall be in the form of a table that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) contains clear and concise headings for each item of such information; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) provides a clear and concise form stating each item of information required to be disclosed under each such heading.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) In prescribing the form of the table under subparagraph (E), the Bureau shall require that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) all of the information in the table, and not just a reference to the table, be placed on the billing statement, as required by this paragraph; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the items required to be included in the table shall be listed in the order in which such items are set forth in subparagraph (B).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) In prescribing the form of the table under subparagraph (D), the Bureau shall employ terminology which is different than the terminology which is employed in subparagraph (B), if such terminology is more easily understood and conveys substantially the same meaning.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) <cap-smallcap>Requirements relating to late payment deadlines and penalties.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>Late payment deadline required to be disclosed</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In the case of a credit card account under an open end consumer credit plan under which a late fee or charge may be imposed due to the failure of the obligor to make payment on or before the due date for such payment, the periodic statement required under subsection (b) with respect to the account shall include, in a conspicuous location on the billing statement, the date on which the payment is due or, if different, the date on which a late payment fee will be charged, together with the amount of the fee or charge to be imposed if payment is made after that date.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Disclosure of increase in interest rates for late payments</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If 1 or more late payments under an open end consumer credit plan may result in an increase in the annual percentage rate applicable to the account, the statement required under subsection (b) with respect to the account shall include conspicuous notice of such fact, together with the applicable penalty annual percentage rate, in close proximity to the disclosure required under subparagraph (A) of the date on which payment is due under the terms of the account.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) <cap-smallcap>Payments at local branches</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the creditor, in the case of a credit card account referred to in subparagraph (A), is a financial institution which maintains branches or offices at which payments on any such account are accepted from the obligor in person, the date on which the obligor makes a payment on the account at such branch or office shall be considered to be the date on which the payment is made for purposes of determining whether a late fee or charge may be imposed due to the failure of the obligor to make payment on or before the due date for such payment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Disclosure in credit and charge card applications and solicitations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Direct mail applications and solicitations</h4>

If the consumer makes the election referred to in paragraph (1), the creditor shall provide notice to the consumer of the right to revoke the election, in the form prescribed by the Bureau, in any periodic statement that includes notice of the imposition of an over-the-limit fee during the period covered by the statement.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Form of election</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A consumer may make or revoke the election referred to in paragraph (1) orally, electronically, or in writing, pursuant to regulations prescribed by the Bureau.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Rule of construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prohibit a creditor from completing an over-the-limit transaction, provided that a consumer who has not made a valid election under paragraph (1) is not charged an over-the-limit fee for such transaction.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Restriction on fees charged for an over-the-limit transaction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">With respect to a credit card account under an open end consumer credit plan, an over-the-limit fee may be imposed only once during a billing cycle if the credit limit on the account is exceeded, and an over-the-limit fee, with respect to such excess credit, may be imposed only once in each of the 2 subsequent billing cycles, unless the consumer has obtained an additional extension of credit in excess of such credit limit during any such subsequent cycle or the consumer reduces the outstanding balance below the credit limit as of the end of such billing cycle.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(l) Limit on fees related to method of payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">With respect to a credit card account under an open end consumer credit plan, the creditor may not impose a separate fee to allow the obligor to repay an extension of credit or finance charge, whether such repayment is made by mail, electronic transfer, telephone authorization, or other means, unless such payment involves an expedited service by a service representative of the creditor.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(m) Use of term &quot;fixed rate&quot;</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">With respect to the terms of any credit card account under an open end consumer credit plan, the term &quot;fixed&quot;, when appearing in conjunction with a reference to the annual percentage rate or interest rate applicable with respect to such account, may only be used to refer to an annual percentage rate or interest rate that will not change or vary for any reason over the period specified clearly and conspicuously in the terms of the account.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(n) Standards applicable to initial issuance of subprime or &quot;fee harvester&quot; cards</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the terms of a credit card account under an open end consumer credit plan require the payment of any fees (other than any late fee, over-the-limit fee, or fee for a payment returned for insufficient funds) by the consumer in the first year during which the account is opened in an aggregate amount in excess of 25 percent of the total amount of credit authorized under the account when the account is opened, no payment of any fees (other than any late fee, over-the-limit fee, or fee for a payment returned for insufficient funds) may be made from the credit made available under the terms of the account.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Rule of construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No provision of this subsection may be construed as authorizing any imposition or payment of advance fees otherwise prohibited by any provision of law.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(o) Due dates for credit card accounts</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(p) Parental approval required to increase credit lines for accounts for which parent is jointly liable</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No increase may be made in the amount of credit authorized to be extended under a credit card account for which a parent, legal guardian, or spouse of the consumer, or any other individual has assumed joint liability for debts incurred by the consumer in connection with the account before the consumer attains the age of 21, unless that parent, guardian, or spouse approves in writing, and assumes joint liability for, such increase.</p>

Such amount shall be computed assuming the consumer makes each monthly payment in full and on-time, and does not make any over-payments.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Form and timing of disclosures; residential mortgage transaction requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as otherwise provided in this part, the disclosures required under subsection (a) shall be made before the credit is extended. Except for the disclosures required by subsection (a)(1) of this section, all disclosures required under subsection (a) and any disclosure provided for in subsection (b), (c), or (d) of section 1605 of this title shall be conspicuously segregated from all other terms, data, or information provided in connection with a transaction, including any computations or itemization.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (G), in the case of any extension of credit that is secured by the dwelling of a consumer, which is also subject to the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act [12 U.S.C. 2601 et seq.], good faith estimates of the disclosures required under subsection (a) shall be made in accordance with regulations of the Bureau under section 1631(c) of this title and shall be delivered or placed in the mail not later than three business days after the creditor receives the consumer's written application, which shall be at least 7 business days before consummation of the transaction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In the case of an extension of credit that is secured by the dwelling of a consumer, the disclosures provided under subparagraph (A),<sup><a href="#1638_1_target" name="1638_1">1</a></sup> <!-- PDFPage:1497 -->shall be in addition to the other disclosures required by subsection (a), and shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) state in conspicuous type size and format, the following: &quot;You are not required to complete this agreement merely because you have received these disclosures or signed a loan application.&quot;; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) be provided in the form of final disclosures at the time of consummation of the transaction, in the form and manner prescribed by this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) In the case of an extension of credit that is secured by the dwelling of a consumer, under which the annual rate of interest is variable, or with respect to which the regular payments may otherwise be variable, in addition to the other disclosures required by subsection (a), the disclosures provided under this subsection shall do the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) Label the payment schedule as follows: &quot;Payment Schedule: Payments Will Vary Based on Interest Rate Changes&quot;.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) State in conspicuous type size and format examples of adjustments to the regular required payment on the extension of credit based on the change in the interest rates specified by the contract for such extension of credit. Among the examples required to be provided under this clause is an example that reflects the maximum payment amount of the regular required payments on the extension of credit, based on the maximum interest rate allowed under the contract, in accordance with the rules of the Bureau. Prior to issuing any rules pursuant to this clause, the Bureau shall conduct consumer testing to determine the appropriate format for providing the disclosures required under this subparagraph to consumers so that such disclosures can be easily understood, including the fact that the initial regular payments are for a specific time period that will end on a certain date, that payments will adjust afterwards potentially to a higher amount, and that there is no guarantee that the borrower will be able to refinance to a lower amount.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(D) In any case in which the disclosure statement under subparagraph (A) contains an annual percentage rate of interest that is no longer accurate, as determined under section 1606(c) of this title, the creditor shall furnish an additional, corrected statement to the borrower, not later than 3 business days before the date of consummation of the transaction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(E) The consumer shall receive the disclosures required under this paragraph before paying any fee to the creditor or other person in connection with the consumer's application for an extension of credit that is secured by the dwelling of a consumer. If the disclosures are mailed to the consumer, the consumer is considered to have received them 3 business days after they are mailed. A creditor or other person may impose a fee for obtaining the consumer's credit report before the consumer has received the disclosures under this paragraph, provided the fee is bona fide and reasonable in amount.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(F) <cap-smallcap>Waiver of timeliness of disclosures</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;To expedite consummation of a transaction, if the consumer determines that the extension of credit is needed to meet a bona fide personal financial emergency, the consumer may waive or modify the timing requirements for disclosures under subparagraph (A), provided that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the term &quot;bona fide personal emergency&quot; may be further defined in regulations issued by the Bureau;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the consumer provides to the creditor a dated, written statement describing the emergency and specifically waiving or modifying those timing requirements, which statement shall bear the signature of all consumers entitled to receive the disclosures required by this paragraph; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the creditor provides to the consumers at or before the time of such waiver or modification, the final disclosures required by paragraph (1).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(G)(i) In the case of an extension of credit relating to a plan described in section 101(53D) of title 11&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) the requirements of subparagraphs (A) through (E) shall not apply; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) a good faith estimate of the disclosures required under subsection (a) shall be made in accordance with regulations of the Bureau under section 1631(c) of this title before such credit is extended, or shall be delivered or placed in the mail not later than 3 business days after the date on which the creditor receives the written application of the consumer for such credit, whichever is earlier.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) If a disclosure statement furnished within 3 business days of the written application (as provided under clause (i)(II)) contains an annual percentage rate which is subsequently rendered inaccurate, within the meaning of section 1606(c) of this title, the creditor shall furnish another disclosure statement at the time of settlement or consummation of the transaction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In the case of a credit transaction described in paragraph (15) of subsection (a), disclosures required by that paragraph shall be made to the consumer at the time of application for such extension of credit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) <cap-smallcap>Repayment analysis required to include escrow payments.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Assessment value</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The amount taken into account under subparagraph (A) for the <!-- PDFPage:1498 -->payment of property taxes, hazard and flood (if any) insurance premiums, or other periodic payments or premiums with respect to the property shall reflect the taxable assessed value of the real property securing the transaction after the consummation of the transaction, including the value of any improvements on the property or to be constructed on the property (whether or not such construction will be financed from the proceeds of the transaction), if known, and the replacement costs of the property for hazard insurance, in the initial year after the transaction.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Timing of disclosures on unsolicited mailed or telephone purchase orders or loan requests</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If a creditor receives a purchase order by mail or telephone without personal solicitation, and the cash price and the total sale price and the terms of financing, including the annual percentage rate, are set forth in the creditor's catalog or other printed material distributed to the public, then the disclosures required under subsection (a) may be made at any time not later than the date the first payment is due.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If a creditor receives a request for a loan by mail or telephone without personal solicitation and the terms of financing, including the annual percentage rate for representative amounts of credit, are set forth in the creditor's printed material distributed to the public, or in the contract of loan or other printed material delivered to the obligor, then the disclosures required under subsection (a) may be made at any time not later than the date the first payment is due.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Timing of disclosure in cases of an addition of a deferred payment price to an existing outstanding balance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a consumer credit sale is one of a series of consumer credit sales transactions made pursuant to an agreement providing for the addition of the deferred payment price of that sale to an existing outstanding balance, and the person to whom the credit is extended has approved in writing both the annual percentage rate or rates and the method of computing the finance charge or charges, and the creditor retains no security interest in any property as to which he has received payments aggregating the amount of the sales price including any finance charges attributable thereto, then the disclosure required under subsection (a) for the particular sale may be made at any time not later than the date the first payment for that sale is due. For the purposes of this subsection, in the case of items purchased on different dates, the first purchased shall be deemed first paid for, and in the case of items purchased on the same date, the lowest price shall be deemed first paid for.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Disclosures</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Specific disclosures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In addition to other disclosures required under this subchapter, for each mortgage referred to in section 1602(aa)&#160;<sup><a href="#1639_1_target" name="1639_1">1</a></sup> of this title, the creditor shall provide the following disclosures in conspicuous type size:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) &quot;You are not required to complete this agreement merely because you have received these disclosures or have signed a loan application.&quot;.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) &quot;If you obtain this loan, the lender will have a mortgage on your home. You could lose your home, and any money you have put into it, if you do not meet your obligations under the loan.&quot;.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Annual percentage rate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In addition to the disclosures required under paragraph (1), the creditor shall disclose&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in the case of a credit transaction with a fixed rate of interest, the annual percentage rate and the amount of the regular monthly payment; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in the case of any other credit transaction, the annual percentage rate of the loan, the amount of the regular monthly payment, a statement that the interest rate <!-- PDFPage:1503 -->and monthly payment may increase, and the amount of the maximum monthly payment, based on the maximum interest rate allowed pursuant to section 3806 of title 12.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Time of disclosures</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The disclosures required by this section shall be given not less than 3 business days prior to consummation of the transaction.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) New disclosures required</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">After providing the disclosures required by this section, a creditor may not change the terms of the extension of credit if such changes make the disclosures inaccurate, unless new disclosures are provided that meet the requirements of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Telephone disclosure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A creditor may provide new disclosures pursuant to subparagraph (A) by telephone, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the change is initiated by the consumer; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) at the consummation of the transaction under which the credit is extended&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the creditor provides to the consumer the new disclosures, in writing; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the creditor and consumer certify in writing that the new disclosures were provided by telephone, by not later than 3 days prior to the date of consummation of the transaction.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) No wait for lower rate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a creditor extends to a consumer a second offer of credit with a lower annual percentage rate, the transaction may be consummated without regard to the period specified in paragraph (1) with respect to the second offer.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Modifications</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Bureau may, if it finds that such action is necessary to permit homeowners to meet bona fide personal financial emergencies, prescribe regulations authorizing the modification or waiver of rights created under this subsection, to the extent and under the circumstances set forth in those regulations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) No prepayment penalty</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general&#160;<sup><a href="#1639_2_target" name="1639_2">2</a></sup></h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Limitation on terms</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A mortgage referred to in section 1602(aa)&#160;<sup><a href="#1639_1_target" name="1639_1">1</a></sup> of this title may not contain terms under which a consumer must pay a prepayment penalty for paying all or part of the principal before the date on which the principal is due.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this subsection, any method of computing a refund of unearned scheduled interest is a prepayment penalty if it is less favorable to the consumer than the actuarial method (as that term is defined in section 1615(d) of this title).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Limitations after default</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A mortgage referred to in section 1602(aa)&#160;<sup><a href="#1639_1_target" name="1639_1">1</a></sup> of this title may not provide for an interest rate applicable after default that is higher than the interest rate that applies before default. If the date of maturity of a mortgage referred to in subsection&#160;<sup><a href="#1639_3_target" name="1639_3">3</a></sup> 1602(aa)&#160;<sup><a href="#1639_1_target" name="1639_1">1</a></sup> of this title is accelerated due to default and the consumer is entitled to a rebate of interest, that rebate shall be computed by any method that is not less favorable than the actuarial method (as that term is defined in section 1615(d) of this title).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) No balloon payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No high-cost mortgage may contain a scheduled payment that is more than twice as large as the average of earlier scheduled payments. This subsection shall not apply when the payment schedule is adjusted to the seasonal or irregular income of the consumer.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) No negative amortization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A mortgage referred to in section 1602(aa)&#160;<sup><a href="#1639_1_target" name="1639_1">1</a></sup> of this title may not include terms under which the outstanding principal balance will increase at any time over the course of the loan because the regular periodic payments do not cover the full amount of interest due.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) No prepaid payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A mortgage referred to in section 1602(aa)&#160;<sup><a href="#1639_1_target" name="1639_1">1</a></sup> of this title may not include terms under which more than 2 periodic payments required under the loan are consolidated and paid in advance from the loan proceeds provided to the consumer.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Prohibition on extending credit without regard to payment ability of consumer</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A creditor shall not engage in a pattern or practice of extending credit to consumers under mortgages referred to in section 1602(aa)&#160;<sup><a href="#1639_1_target" name="1639_1">1</a></sup> of this title based on the consumers&apos; collateral without regard to the consumers&apos; repayment ability, including the consumers&apos; current and expected income, current obligations, and employment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Requirements for payments under home improvement contracts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A creditor shall not make a payment to a contractor under a home improvement contract from amounts extended as credit under a mortgage referred to in section 1602(aa)&#160;<sup><a href="#1639_1_target" name="1639_1">1</a></sup> of this title, other than&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in the form of an instrument that is payable to the consumer or jointly to the consumer and the contractor; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) at the election of the consumer, by a third party escrow agent in accordance with terms established in a written agreement signed by the consumer, the creditor, and the contractor before the date of payment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Recommended default</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No creditor shall recommend or encourage default on an existing loan or other debt prior to and in connection with the closing or planned closing of a high-cost mortgage that refinances all or any portion of such existing loan or debt.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1504 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Late fees</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No creditor may impose a late payment charge or fee in connection with a high-cost mortgage&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in an amount in excess of 4 percent of the amount of the payment past due;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) unless the loan documents specifically authorize the charge or fee;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) before the end of the 15-day period beginning on the date the payment is due, or in the case of a loan on which interest on each installment is paid in advance, before the end of the 30-day period beginning on the date the payment is due; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) more than once with respect to a single late payment.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Coordination with subsequent late fees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a payment is otherwise a full payment for the applicable period and is paid on its due date or within an applicable grace period, and the only delinquency or insufficiency of payment is attributable to any late fee or delinquency charge assessed on any earlier payment, no late fee or delinquency charge may be imposed on such payment.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Failure to make installment payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, in the case of a loan agreement the terms of which provide that any payment shall first be applied to any past due principal balance, the consumer fails to make an installment payment and the consumer subsequently resumes making installment payments but has not paid all past due installments, the creditor may impose a separate late payment charge or fee for any principal due (without deduction due to late fees or related fees) until the default is cured.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(l) Acceleration of debt</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No high-cost mortgage may contain a provision which permits the creditor to accelerate the indebtedness, except when repayment of the loan has been accelerated by default in payment, or pursuant to a due-on-sale provision, or pursuant to a material violation of some other provision of the loan document unrelated to payment schedule.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(m) Restriction on financing points and fees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No creditor may directly or indirectly finance, in connection with any high-cost mortgage, any of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Any prepayment fee or penalty payable by the consumer in a refinancing transaction if the creditor or an affiliate of the creditor is the noteholder of the note being refinanced.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Any points or fees.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(n) Consequence of failure to comply</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any mortgage that contains a provision prohibited by this section shall be deemed a failure to deliver the material disclosures required under this subchapter, for the purpose of section 1635 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(o) &quot;Affiliate&quot; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term &quot;affiliate&quot; has the same meaning as in section 1841(k) of title 12.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(p) Discretionary regulatory authority of Bureau</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Exemptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Bureau may, by regulation or order, exempt specific mortgage products or categories of mortgages from any or all of the prohibitions specified in subsections (c) through (i), if the Bureau finds that the exemption&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is in the interest of the borrowing public; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) will apply only to products that maintain and strengthen home ownership and equity protection.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Prohibitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Bureau, by regulation or order, shall prohibit acts or practices in connection with&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) mortgage loans that the Bureau finds to be unfair, deceptive, or designed to evade the provisions of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) refinancing of mortgage loans that the Bureau finds to be associated with abusive lending practices, or that are otherwise not in the interest of the borrower.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(q) Civil penalties in Federal Trade Commission enforcement actions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of enforcement by the Federal Trade Commission, any violation of a regulation issued by the Bureau pursuant to subsection (l)(2) shall be treated as a violation of a rule promulgated under section 57a of this title regarding unfair or deceptive acts or practices.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(r) Prohibitions on evasions, structuring of transactions, and reciprocal arrangements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A creditor may not take any action in connection with a high-cost mortgage&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to structure a loan transaction as an open-end credit plan or another form of loan for the purpose and with the intent of evading the provisions of this subchapter; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to divide any loan transaction into separate parts for the purpose and with the intent of evading provisions of this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(s) Modification and deferral fees prohibited</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A creditor, successor in interest, assignee, or any agent of any of the above, may not charge a consumer any fee to modify, renew, extend, or amend a high-cost mortgage, or to defer any payment due under the terms of such mortgage.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(t) Payoff statement</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Fees</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in subparagraph (B), no creditor or servicer may charge a fee for informing or transmitting to any person the balance due to pay off the outstanding balance on a high-cost mortgage.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Transaction fee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">When payoff information referred to in subparagraph (A) is provided by facsimile transmission or by a courier service, a creditor or servicer may charge a processing fee to cover the cost of such transmission or service in an amount not to exceed an amount that is comparable to fees imposed for similar services provided in connection with consumer credit transactions that are secured by the consumer's principal dwelling and are not high-cost mortgages.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1505 --><h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Fee disclosure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Prior to charging a transaction fee as provided in subparagraph (B), a creditor or servicer shall disclose that payoff balances are available for free pursuant to subparagraph (A).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Multiple requests</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a creditor or servicer has provided payoff information referred to in subparagraph (A) without charge, other than the transaction fee allowed by subparagraph (B), on 4 occasions during a calendar year, the creditor or servicer may thereafter charge a reasonable fee for providing such information during the remainder of the calendar year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Prompt delivery</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Payoff balances shall be provided within 5 business days after receiving a request by a consumer or a person authorized by the consumer to obtain such information.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(u) Pre-loan counseling</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A creditor may not extend credit to a consumer under a high-cost mortgage without first receiving certification from a counselor that is approved by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, or at the discretion of the Secretary, a State housing finance authority, that the consumer has received counseling on the advisability of the mortgage. Such counselor shall not be employed by the creditor or an affiliate of the creditor or be affiliated with the creditor.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Disclosures required prior to counseling</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No counselor may certify that a consumer has received counseling on the advisability of the high-cost mortgage unless the counselor can verify that the consumer has received each statement required (in connection with such loan) by this section or the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974 [12 U.S.C. 2601 et seq.] with respect to the transaction.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Board&#160;<sup><a href="#1639_4_target" name="1639_4">4</a></sup> may prescribe such regulations as the Board determines to be appropriate to carry out the requirements of paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(v) Corrections and unintentional violations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A creditor or assignee in a high-cost mortgage who, when acting in good faith, fails to comply with any requirement under this section will not be deemed to have violated such requirement if the creditor or assignee establishes that either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) within 30 days of the loan closing and prior to the institution of any action, the consumer is notified of or discovers the violation, appropriate restitution is made, and whatever adjustments are necessary are made to the loan to either, at the choice of the consumer&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) make the loan satisfy the requirements of this part; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in the case of a high-cost mortgage, change the terms of the loan in a manner beneficial to the consumer so that the loan will no longer be a high-cost mortgage; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) within 60 days of the creditor's discovery or receipt of notification of an unintentional violation or bona fide error and prior to the institution of any action, the consumer is notified of the compliance failure, appropriate restitution is made, and whatever adjustments are necessary are made to the loan to either, at the choice of the consumer&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) make the loan satisfy the requirements of this part; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in the case of a high-cost mortgage, change the terms of the loan in a manner beneficial so that the loan will no longer be a high-cost mortgage.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to the extent that the servicer owes a duty to investors or other parties to maximize the net present value of such mortgages, the duty shall be construed to apply to all such investors and parties, and not to any individual party or group of parties; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the servicer shall be deemed to have satisfied the duty set forth in paragraph (1) if, before December 31, 2012, the servicer implements a qualified loss mitigation plan that meets the following criteria:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Default on the payment of such mortgage has occurred, is imminent, or is reasonably foreseeable, as such terms are defined by guidelines issued by the Secretary of the Treasury or his designee under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 [12 U.S.C. 5201 et seq.].</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The mortgagor occupies the property securing the mortgage as his or her principal residence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) The servicer reasonably determined, consistent with the guidelines issued by the Secretary of the Treasury or his designee, that the application of such qualified loss mitigation plan to a mortgage or class of mortgages will likely provide an anticipated recovery on the outstanding principal mortgage debt that will exceed the anticipated recovery through foreclosures.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) No liability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A servicer that is deemed to be acting in the best interests of all investors or other parties under this section shall not be liable to any party who is owed a duty under subsection (a)(1), and shall not be subject to any injunction, stay, or other equitable relief to such party, based solely upon the implementation by the servicer of a qualified loss mitigation plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Standard industry practice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The qualified loss mitigation plan guidelines issued by the Secretary of the Treasury under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 [12 U.S.C. 5201 et seq.] shall constitute standard industry practice for purposes of all Federal and State laws.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Scope of safe harbor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any person, including a trustee, issuer, and loan originator, shall not be liable for monetary damages or be subject to an injunction, stay, or other equitable relief, based solely upon the cooperation of such person with a servicer when such cooperation is necessary for the servicer to implement a qualified loss mitigation plan that meets the requirements of subsection (a).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Reporting</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each servicer that engages in qualified loss mitigation plans under this section shall regularly report to the Secretary of the Treasury the extent, scope, and results of the servicer's modification activities. The Secretary of the Treasury shall prescribe regulations or guidance specifying the form, content, and timing of such reports.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1639b. Residential mortgage loan origination</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Finding and purpose</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Finding</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Congress finds that economic stabilization would be enhanced by the protection, limitation, and regulation of the terms of residential mortgage credit and the practices related to such credit, while ensuring that responsible, affordable mortgage credit remains available to consumers.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">It is the purpose of this section and section 1639c of this title to assure that consumers are offered and receive residential mortgage loans on terms that reasonably reflect their ability to repay the loans and that are understandable and not unfair, deceptive or abusive.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Duty of care</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Standard</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to regulations prescribed under this subsection, each mortgage originator shall, in addition to the duties imposed by otherwise applicable provisions of State or Federal law&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) be qualified and, when required, registered and licensed as a mortgage originator in accordance with applicable State or Federal law, including the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 [12 U.S.C. 5101 et seq.]; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) include on all loan documents any unique identifier of the mortgage originator provided by the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Compliance procedures required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Bureau shall prescribe regulations requiring depository institutions to establish and maintain procedures reasonably designed to assure and monitor the compliance of such depository institutions, the subsidiaries of such institutions, and the employees of such institutions or subsidiaries with the requirements of this section and the registration procedures established under section 1507 of the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 [12 U.S.C. 5106].</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Prohibition on steering incentives</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For any residential mortgage loan, no mortgage originator shall receive from any person and no person shall pay to a mortgage originator, directly or indirectly, compensation that varies based on the terms of the loan (other than the amount of the principal).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Restructuring of financing origination fee</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For any mortgage loan, a mortgage originator may not receive from any person other than the consumer and no person, other than the consumer, who knows or has reason to know that a consumer has directly compensated or will directly compensate a mortgage originator may pay a mortgage originator any origination fee or charge except bona fide third party charges not retained by the creditor, mortgage originator, or an affiliate of the creditor or mortgage originator.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), a mortgage originator may receive from a person other than the consumer an origination fee or charge, and a person other than the consumer may pay a mortgage originator an origination fee or charge, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the mortgage originator does not receive any compensation directly from the consumer; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the consumer does not make an upfront payment of discount points, origination points, or fees, however denominated (other than bona fide third party charges not retained by the mortgage originator, creditor, or an affiliate of the creditor or originator), except that the Bureau may, by rule, waive or provide exemptions to this clause if the Bureau determines that such waiver or exemption is in the interest of consumers and in the public interest.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1508 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Bureau shall prescribe regulations to prohibit&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) mortgage originators from steering any consumer to a residential mortgage loan that&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) mortgage originators from steering any consumer from a residential mortgage loan for which the consumer is qualified that is a qualified mortgage (as defined in section 1639c(b)(2) of this title) to a residential mortgage loan that is not a qualified mortgage;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) abusive or unfair lending practices that promote disparities among consumers of equal credit worthiness but of different race, ethnicity, gender, or age; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) mortgage originators from&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) mischaracterizing the credit history of a consumer or the residential mortgage loans available to a consumer;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) mischaracterizing or suborning the mischaracterization of the appraised value of the property securing the extension of credit; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) if unable to suggest, offer, or recommend to a consumer a loan that is not more expensive than a loan for which the consumer qualifies, discouraging a consumer from seeking a residential mortgage loan secured by a consumer's principal dwelling from another mortgage originator.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Rules of construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No provision of this subsection shall be construed as&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) permitting any yield spread premium or other similar compensation that would, for any residential mortgage loan, permit the total amount of direct and indirect compensation from all sources permitted to a mortgage originator to vary based on the terms of the loan (other than the amount of the principal);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) limiting or affecting the amount of compensation received by a creditor upon the sale of a consummated loan to a subsequent purchaser;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) restricting a consumer's ability to finance, at the option of the consumer, including through principal or rate, any origination fees or costs permitted under this subsection, or the mortgage originator's right to receive such fees or costs (including compensation) from any person, subject to paragraph (2)(B), so long as such fees or costs do not vary based on the terms of the loan (other than the amount of the principal) or the consumer's decision about whether to finance such fees or costs; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) prohibiting incentive payments to a mortgage originator based on the number of residential mortgage loans originated within a specified period of time.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Liability for violations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of providing a cause of action for any failure by a mortgage originator, other than a creditor, to comply with any requirement imposed under this section and any regulation prescribed under this section, section 1640 of this title shall be applied with respect to any such failure by substituting &quot;mortgage originator&quot; for &quot;creditor&quot; each place such term appears in each such subsection.<sup><a href="#1639b_1_target" name="1639b_1">1</a></sup></p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Maximum</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The maximum amount of any liability of a mortgage originator under paragraph (1) to a consumer for any violation of this section shall not exceed the greater of actual damages or an amount equal to 3 times the total amount of direct and indirect compensation or gain accruing to the mortgage originator in connection with the residential mortgage loan involved in the violation, plus the costs to the consumer of the action, including a reasonable attorney's fee.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Discretionary regulatory authority</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Bureau shall, by regulations, prohibit or condition terms, acts or practices relating to residential mortgage loans that the Bureau finds to be abusive, unfair, deceptive, predatory, necessary or proper to ensure that responsible, affordable mortgage credit remains available to consumers in a manner consistent with the purposes of this section and section 1639c of this title, necessary or proper to effectuate the purposes of this section and section 1639c of this title, to prevent circumvention or evasion thereof, or to facilitate compliance with such sections, or are not in the interest of the borrower.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Application</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The regulations prescribed under paragraph (1) shall be applicable to all residential mortgage loans and shall be applied in the same manner as regulations prescribed under section 1604 of this title.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1639c. Minimum standards for residential mortgage loans</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Ability to repay</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In accordance with regulations prescribed by the Bureau, no creditor may make a residential mortgage loan unless the creditor makes a reasonable and good faith determination based on verified and documented information that, at the time the loan is consummated, the consumer has a reasonable ability to repay the loan, according to its terms, and all applicable taxes, insurance (including mortgage guarantee insurance), and assessments.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Multiple loans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the creditor knows, or has reason to know, that 1 or more residential mortgage loans secured by the same dwelling will be made to the same consumer, the creditor shall make a reasonable and good faith determination, based on verified and documented information, that the consumer has a reasonable ability to repay the combined payments of all loans on the same dwelling according to the terms of those loans and all applicable taxes, insurance (including mortgage guarantee insurance), and assessments.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Basis for determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A determination under this subsection of a consumer's ability to repay a residential mortgage loan shall include consideration of the consumer's credit history, current income, expected income the consumer is reasonably assured of receiving, current obligations, debt-to-income ratio or the residual income the consumer will have after paying non-mortgage debt and mortgage-related obligations, employment status, and other financial resources other than the consumer's equity in the dwelling or real property that secures repayment of the loan. A creditor shall determine the ability of the consumer to repay using a payment schedule that fully amortizes the loan over the term of the loan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Income verification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A creditor making a residential mortgage loan shall verify amounts of income or assets that such creditor relies on to determine repayment ability, including expected income or assets, by reviewing the consumer's Internal Revenue Service Form W&ndash;2, tax returns, payroll receipts, financial institution records, or other third-party documents that provide reasonably reliable evidence of the consumer's income or assets. In order to safeguard against fraudulent reporting, any consideration of a consumer's income history in making a determination under this subsection shall include the verification of such income by the use of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Internal Revenue Service transcripts of tax returns; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a method that quickly and effectively verifies income documentation by a third party subject to rules prescribed by the Bureau.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Exemption</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">With respect to loans made, guaranteed, or insured by Federal departments or agencies identified in subsection (b)(3)(B)(ii), such departments or agencies may exempt refinancings under a streamlined refinancing from this income verification requirement as long as the following conditions are met:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The consumer is not 30 days or more past due on the prior existing residential mortgage loan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The refinancing does not increase the principal balance outstanding on the prior existing residential mortgage loan, except to the extent of fees and charges allowed by the department or agency making, guaranteeing, or insuring the refinancing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Total points and fees (as defined in section 1602(aa)(4)&#160;<sup><a href="#1639c_1_target" name="1639c_1">1</a></sup> of this title, other than bona fide third party charges not retained by the mortgage originator, creditor, or an affiliate of the creditor or mortgage originator) payable in connection with the refinancing do not exceed 3 percent of the total new loan amount.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) The interest rate on the refinanced loan is lower than the interest rate of the <!-- PDFPage:1510 -->original loan, unless the borrower is refinancing from an adjustable rate to a fixed-rate loan, under guidelines that the department or agency shall establish for loans they make, guarantee, or issue.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) The refinancing is subject to a payment schedule that will fully amortize the refinancing in accordance with the regulations prescribed by the department or agency making, guaranteeing, or insuring the refinancing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) The terms of the refinancing do not result in a balloon payment, as defined in subsection (b)(2)(A)(ii).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) Both the residential mortgage loan being refinanced and the refinancing satisfy all requirements of the department or agency making, guaranteeing, or insuring the refinancing.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Nonstandard loans</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Variable rate loans that defer repayment of any principal or interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of determining, under this subsection, a consumer's ability to repay a variable rate residential mortgage loan that allows or requires the consumer to defer the repayment of any principal or interest, the creditor shall use a fully amortizing repayment schedule.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Interest-only loans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of determining, under this subsection, a consumer's ability to repay a residential mortgage loan that permits or requires the payment of interest only, the creditor shall use the payment amount required to amortize the loan by its final maturity.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Calculation for negative amortization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In making any determination under this subsection, a creditor shall also take into consideration any balance increase that may accrue from any negative amortization provision.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Calculation process</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Exemptions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Except as otherwise specifically provided in this subchapter, any civil action for a violation of this subchapter or proceeding under section 1607 of this title which may be brought against a creditor may be maintained against any assignee of such creditor only if the violation for which such action or proceeding is brought is apparent on the face of the disclosure statement, except where the assignment was involuntary. For the purpose of this section, a violation apparent on the face of the disclosure statement includes, but is not limited to (1) a disclosure which can be determined to be incomplete or inaccurate from the face of the disclosure statement or other documents assigned, or (2) a disclosure which does not use the terms required to be used by this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Proof of compliance with statutory provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in section 1635(c) of this title, in any action or proceeding by or against any subsequent assignee of the original creditor without knowledge to the contrary by the assignee when he acquires the obligation, written acknowledgement of receipt by a person to whom a statement is required to be given pursuant to this subchapter shall be conclusive proof of the delivery thereof and, except as provided in subsection (a), of compliance with this part. This section does not affect the rights of the obligor in any action against the original creditor.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Right of rescission by consumer unaffected</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any consumer who has the right to rescind a transaction under section 1635 of this title may rescind the transaction as against any assignee of the obligation.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>

The preceding sentence does not affect rights of a consumer under subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this section or any other provision of this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Limitation on damages</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, relief provided as a result of any action made permissible by paragraph (1) may not exceed&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any person who sells or otherwise assigns a mortgage referred to in section 1602(aa)&#160;<sup><a href="#1641_1_target" name="1641_1">1</a></sup> of this title shall include a prominent notice of the potential liability under this subsection as determined by the Bureau.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Liability of assignee for consumer credit transactions secured by real property</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the violation for which such action or proceeding is brought is apparent on the face of the disclosure statement provided in connection with such transaction pursuant to this subchapter; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the assignment to the assignee was voluntary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Violation apparent on the face of the disclosure described</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the disclosure statement does not use the terms or format required to be used by this subchapter.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Servicer not treated as owner on basis of assignment for administrative convenience</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A servicer of a consumer obligation arising from a consumer credit transaction shall not be treated as the owner of the obligation for purposes of this section on the basis of an assignment of the obligation from the creditor or another assignee to the servicer solely for the administrative convenience of the servicer in servicing the obligation. Upon written request by the obligor, the servicer shall provide the obligor, to the best knowledge of the servicer, with the name, address, and telephone number of the owner of the obligation or the master servicer of the obligation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) &quot;Servicer&quot; defined</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The amount of any penalty fee or charge that a card issuer may impose with respect to a credit card account under an open end consumer credit plan in connection with any omission with respect to, or violation of, the cardholder agreement, including any late payment fee, over-the-limit fee, or any other penalty fee or charge, shall be reasonable and proportional to such omission or violation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Rulemaking required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Bureau, in consultation with the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Directors of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Director of the Office of Thrift Supervision, and the National Credit Union Administration Board, shall issue final rules not later than 9 months after May 22, 2009, to establish standards for assessing whether the amount of any penalty fee or charge described under subsection (a) is reasonable and proportional to the omission or violation to which the fee or charge relates. Subsection (a) shall become effective 15 months after May 22, 2009.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Considerations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In issuing rules required by this section, the Bureau shall consider&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Written notice by obligor to creditor; time for and contents of notice; procedure upon receipt of notice by creditor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a creditor, within sixty days after having transmitted to an obligor a statement of the obligor's account in connection with an extension of consumer credit, receives at the address disclosed under section 1637(b)(10) of this title a written notice (other than notice on a payment stub or other payment medium supplied by the creditor if the creditor so stipulates with the disclosure required under section 1637(a)(7) of this title) from the obligor in which the obligor&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) sets forth or otherwise enables the creditor to identify the name and account number (if any) of the obligor,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) indicates the obligor's belief that the statement contains a billing error and the amount of such billing error, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) sets forth the reasons for the obligor's belief (to the extent applicable) that the statement contains a billing error,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the creditor shall, unless the obligor has, after giving such written notice and before the expiration of the time limits herein specified, agreed that the statement was correct&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) not later than thirty days after the receipt of the notice, send a written acknowledgment thereof to the obligor, unless the action required in subparagraph (B) is taken within such thirty-day period, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) not later than two complete billing cycles of the creditor (in no event later than ninety days) after the receipt of the notice and prior to taking any action to collect the amount, or any part thereof, indicated by the obligor under paragraph (2) either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) make appropriate corrections in the account of the obligor, including the crediting of any finance charges on amounts erroneously billed, and transmit to the obligor a notification of such corrections and the creditor's explanation of any change in the amount indicated by the obligor under paragraph (2) and, if any such change is made and the obligor so requests, copies of documentary evidence of the obligor's indebtedness; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) send a written explanation or clarification to the obligor, after having conducted an investigation, setting forth to the extent applicable the reasons why the creditor believes the account of the obligor was correctly shown in the statement and, upon request of the obligor, provide copies of documentary evidence of the obligor's indebtedness. In the case of a billing error where the obligor alleges that the creditor's billing statement reflects goods not delivered to the obligor or his designee in accordance with the agreement made at the time of the transaction, a creditor may not construe such amount to be correctly shown unless he determines that such goods were actually delivered, mailed, or otherwise sent to the obligor and provides the obligor with a statement of such determination.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">After complying with the provisions of this subsection with respect to an alleged billing error, a creditor has no further responsibility under this section if the obligor continues to make substantially the same allegation with respect to such error.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Billing error</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purpose of this section, a &quot;billing error&quot; consists of any of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) A reflection on a statement of an extension of credit which was not made to the obligor or, if made, was not in the amount reflected on such statement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) A reflection on a statement of an extension of credit for which the obligor requests additional clarification including documentary evidence thereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) A reflection on a statement of goods or services not accepted by the obligor or his designee or not delivered to the obligor or his designee in accordance with the agreement made at the time of a transaction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The creditor's failure to reflect properly on a statement a payment made by the obligor or a credit issued to the obligor.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1540 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) A computation error or similar error of an accounting nature of the creditor on a statement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Failure to transmit the statement required under section 1637(b) of this title to the last address of the obligor which has been disclosed to the creditor, unless that address was furnished less than twenty days before the end of the billing cycle for which the statement is required.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Any other error described in regulations of the Bureau.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Action by creditor to collect amount or any part thereof regarded by obligor to be a billing error</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purposes of this section, &quot;action to collect the amount, or any part thereof, indicated by an obligor under paragraph (2)&quot; does not include the sending of statements of account, which may include finance charges on amounts in dispute, to the obligor following written notice from the obligor as specified under subsection (a), if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the obligor's account is not restricted or closed because of the failure of the obligor to pay the amount indicated under paragraph (2) of subsection (a), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the creditor indicates the payment of such amount is not required pending the creditor's compliance with this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit any action by a creditor to collect any amount which has not been indicated by the obligor to contain a billing error.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Restricting or closing by creditor of account regarded by obligor to contain a billing error</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Pursuant to regulations of the Bureau, a creditor operating an open end consumer credit plan may not, prior to the sending of the written explanation or clarification required under paragraph (B)(ii), restrict or close an account with respect to which the obligor has indicated pursuant to subsection (a) that he believes such account to contain a billing error solely because of the obligor's failure to pay the amount indicated to be in error. Nothing in this subsection shall be deemed to prohibit a creditor from applying against the credit limit on the obligor's account the amount indicated to be in error.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Effect of noncompliance with requirements by creditor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any creditor who fails to comply with the requirements of this section or section 1666a of this title forfeits any right to collect from the obligor the amount indicated by the obligor under paragraph (2) of subsection (a) of this section, and any finance charges thereon, except that the amount required to be forfeited under this subsection may not exceed $50.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">After receiving a notice from an obligor as provided in section 1666(a) of this title, a creditor or his agent may not directly or indirectly threaten to report to any person adversely on the obligor's credit rating or credit standing because of the obligor's failure to pay the amount indicated by the obligor under section 1666(a)(2) of this title, and such amount may not be reported as delinquent to any third party until the creditor has met the requirements of section 1666 of this title and has allowed the obligor the same number of days (not less than ten) thereafter to make payment as is provided under the credit agreement with the obligor for the payment of undisputed amounts.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1541 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Reports by creditor on delinquent amounts in dispute; notification of obligor of parties notified of delinquency</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a creditor receives a further written notice from an obligor that an amount is still in dispute within the time allowed for payment under subsection (a) of this section, a creditor may not report to any third party that the amount of the obligor is delinquent because the obligor has failed to pay an amount which he has indicated under section 1666(a)(2) of this title, unless the creditor also reports that the amount is in dispute and, at the same time, notifies the obligor of the name and address of each party to whom the creditor is reporting information concerning the delinquency.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Reports by creditor of subsequent resolution of delinquent amounts</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Payments received from an obligor under an open end consumer credit plan by the creditor shall be posted promptly to the obligor's account as specified in regulations of the Bureau. Such regulations shall prevent a finance charge from being imposed on any obligor if the creditor has received the obligor's payment in readily identifiable form, by 5:00 p.m. on the date on which such payment is due, in the amount, manner, and location indicated by the creditor to avoid the imposition thereof.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Application of payments</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Upon receipt of a payment from a cardholder, the card issuer shall apply amounts in excess of the minimum payment amount first to the card balance bearing the highest rate of interest, and then to each successive balance bearing the next highest rate of interest, until the payment is exhausted.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Clarification relating to certain deferred interest arrangements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A creditor shall allocate the entire amount paid by the consumer in excess of the minimum payment amount to a balance on which interest is deferred during the last 2 billing cycles immediately preceding the expiration of the period during which interest is deferred.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Changes by card issuer</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a card issuer makes a material change in the mailing address, office, or procedures for handling cardholder payments, and such change causes a material delay in the crediting of a cardholder payment made during the 60-day period following the date on which such change took effect, the card issuer may not impose any late fee or finance charge for a late payment on the credit card account to which such payment was credited.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Claims and defenses assertible</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to the limitation contained in subsection (b), a card issuer who has issued a credit card to a cardholder pursuant to an open end consumer credit plan shall be subject to all claims (other than tort claims) and defenses arising out of any transaction in which the credit card is used as a method of payment or extension of credit if (1) the obligor has made a good faith attempt to obtain satisfactory resolution of a disagreement or problem relative to the transaction from the person honoring the credit card; (2) the amount of the initial transaction exceeds $50; and (3) the place where the initial transaction occurred was in the same State as the mailing address previously provided by the cardholder or was within 100 miles from such address, except that the limitations set forth in clauses (2) and (3) with respect to an obligor's right to assert claims and defenses against a card issuer shall not be applicable to any transaction in which the person honoring the credit card (A) is the same person as the card issuer, (B) is controlled by the card issuer, (C) is under direct or indirect common control with the card issuer, (D) is a franchised dealer in the card issuer's products or services, or (E) has obtained the order for such transaction through a mail solicitation made by or participated in by the card issuer in which the cardholder is solicited to enter into such transaction by using the credit card issued by the card issuer.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Amount of claims and defenses assertible</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The amount of claims or defenses asserted by the cardholder may not exceed the amount of credit outstanding with respect to such transaction at the time the cardholder first notifies the card issuer or the person honoring the credit <!-- PDFPage:1544 -->card of such claim or defense. For the purpose of determining the amount of credit outstanding in the preceding sentence, payments and credits to the cardholder's account are deemed to have been applied, in the order indicated, to the payment of: (1) late charges in the order of their entry to the account; (2) finance charges in order of their entry to the account; and (3) debits to the account other than those set forth above, in the order in which each debit entry to the account was made.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Estimated residual value of property as basis; presumptions; action by lessor for excess liability; mutually agreeable final adjustment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Where the lessee's liability on expiration of a consumer lease is based on the estimated residual value of the property such estimated residual value shall be a reasonable approximation of the anticipated actual fair market value of the property on lease expiration. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that the estimated residual value is unreasonable to the extent that the estimated residual value exceeds the actual residual value by more than three times the average payment allocable to a monthly period under the lease. In addition, where the lessee has such liability on expiration of a consumer lease there shall be a rebuttable presumption that the lessor's estimated residual value is not in good faith to the extent that the estimated residual value exceeds the actual residual value by more than three times the average payment allocable to a monthly period under the lease and such lessor shall not collect from the lessee the amount of such excess liability on expiration of a consumer lease unless the lessor brings a successful action with respect to such excess liability. In all actions, the lessor shall pay the lessee's reasonable attorney's fees. The presumptions stated in this section shall not apply to the extent the excess of estimated over actual residual value is due to physical damage to the property beyond reasonable wear and use, or to excessive use, and the lease may set standards for such wear and use if such standards are not unreasonable. Nothing in this subsection shall preclude the right of a willing lessee to make any mutually agreeable final adjustment with respect to such excess residual liability, provided such an agreement is reached after termination of the lease.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Penalties and charges for delinquency, default, or early termination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Penalties or other charges for delinquency, default, or early termination may be specified in the lease but only at an amount which is reasonable in the light of the anticipated or actual harm caused by the delinquency, default, or early termination, the difficulties of proof of loss, and the inconvenience or nonfeasibility of otherwise obtaining an adequate remedy.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Independent professional appraisal of residual value of property at termination of lease; finality</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a lease has a residual value provision at the termination of the lease, the lessee may obtain at his expense, a professional appraisal of the leased property by an independent third party agreed to by both parties. Such appraisal shall be final and binding on the parties.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Disadvantages of garnishment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The unrestricted garnishment of compensation due for personal services encourages the making of predatory extensions of credit. Such extensions of credit divert money into excessive credit payments and thereby hinder the production and flow of goods in interstate commerce.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The application of garnishment as a creditors&apos; remedy frequently results in loss of employment by the debtor, and the resulting disruption of employment, production, and consumption constitutes a substantial burden on interstate commerce.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The great disparities among the laws of the several States relating to garnishment have, in effect, destroyed the uniformity of the bankruptcy laws and frustrated the purposes thereof in many areas of the country.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Necessity for regulation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">On the basis of the findings stated in subsection (a) of this section, the Congress determines that the provisions of this subchapter are necessary and proper for the purpose of carrying into execution the powers of the Congress to regulate commerce and to establish uniform bankruptcy laws.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Consumers have a vital interest in establishing and maintaining their credit worthiness and credit standing in order to obtain and use credit. As a result, consumers who have experienced credit problems may seek assistance from credit repair organizations which offer to improve the credit standing of such consumers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Certain advertising and business practices of some companies engaged in the business of credit repair services have worked a financial hardship upon consumers, particularly those of limited economic means and who are inexperienced in credit matters.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purposes of this subchapter are&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to ensure that prospective buyers of the services of credit repair organizations are provided with the information necessary to make an informed decision regarding the purchase of such services; and</p>

<h3 class="analysis-subhead"><strong>&quot;Consumer Credit File Rights Under State and Federal Law</strong></h3>
<p class="statutory-body">&quot;You have a right to dispute inaccurate information in your credit report by contacting the credit bureau directly. However, neither you nor any &apos;credit repair&apos; company or credit repair organization has the right to have accurate, current, and verifiable information removed from your credit report. The credit bureau must remove accurate, negative information from your report only if it is over 7 years old. Bankruptcy information can be reported for 10 years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">&quot;You have a right to obtain a copy of your credit report from a credit bureau. You may be charged a reasonable fee. There is no fee, however, if you have been turned down for credit, employment, insurance, or a rental dwelling because of information in your credit report within the preceding 60 days. The credit bureau must provide someone to help you interpret the information in your credit file. You are entitled to receive a free copy of your credit report if you are unemployed and intend to apply for employment in the next 60 days, if you are a recipient of public welfare assistance, or if you have reason to believe that there is inaccurate information in your credit report due to fraud.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">&quot;You have a right to sue a credit repair organization that violates the Credit Repair Organization Act. This law prohibits deceptive practices by credit repair organizations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">&quot;You have the right to cancel your contract with any credit repair organization for any reason within 3 business days from the date you signed it.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">&quot;Credit bureaus are required to follow reasonable procedures to ensure that the information they report is accurate. However, mistakes may occur.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">&quot;You may, on your own, notify a credit bureau in writing that you dispute the accuracy of information in your credit file. The credit bureau must then reinvestigate and modify or remove inaccurate or incomplete information. The credit bureau may not charge any fee for this service. Any pertinent information and copies of all documents you have concerning an error should be given to the credit bureau.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">&quot;If the credit bureau's reinvestigation does not resolve the dispute to your satisfaction, you may send a brief statement to the credit bureau, to be kept in your file, explaining why you think the record is inaccurate. The credit bureau must include a summary of your statement about disputed information with any report it issues about you.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">&quot;The Federal Trade Commission regulates credit bureaus and credit repair organizations. For more information contact:</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Retention of compliance records</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The banking system is dependent upon fair and accurate credit reporting. Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence which is essential to the continued functioning of the banking system.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An elaborate mechanism has been developed for investigating and evaluating the credit worthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, character, and general reputation of consumers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Consumer reporting agencies have assumed a vital role in assembling and evaluating consumer credit and other information on consumers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) There is a need to insure that consumer reporting agencies exercise their grave responsibilities with fairness, impartiality, and a respect for the consumer's right to privacy.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Reasonable procedures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the purpose of this subchapter to require that consumer reporting agencies adopt reasonable procedures for meeting the needs of commerce for consumer credit, personnel, insurance, and other information in a manner which is fair and equitable to the consumer, with regard to the confidentiality, accuracy, relevancy, and proper utilization of such information in accordance with the requirements of this subchapter.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Notice of rights</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">At any time a consumer is required to receive a summary of rights required under section 1681g of this title, the following notice shall be included:</p>
<h3 class="analysis-subhead"><cap-smallcap>&quot;Consumers Have the Right To Obtain a Security Freeze</cap-smallcap></h3>
<p class="statutory-body">&quot;You have a right to place a &apos;security freeze&apos; on your credit report, which will prohibit a consumer reporting agency from releasing information in your credit report without your express authorization. The security freeze is designed to <!-- PDFPage:1576 -->prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. However, you should be aware that using a security freeze to take control over who gets access to the personal and financial information in your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any other account involving the extension of credit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">&quot;As an alternative to a security freeze, you have the right to place an initial or extended fraud alert on your credit file at no cost. An initial fraud alert is a 1-year alert that is placed on a consumer's credit file. Upon seeing a fraud alert display on a consumer's credit file, a business is required to take steps to verify the consumer's identity before extending new credit. If you are a victim of identity theft, you are entitled to an extended fraud alert, which is a fraud alert lasting 7 years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">&quot;A security freeze does not apply to a person or entity, or its affiliates, or collection agencies acting on behalf of the person or entity, with which you have an existing account that requests information in your credit report for the purposes of reviewing or collecting the account. Reviewing the account includes activities related to account maintenance, monitoring, credit line increases, and account upgrades and enhancements.&quot;.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Block</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as otherwise provided in this section, a consumer reporting agency shall block the reporting of any information in the file of a consumer that the consumer identifies as information that resulted from an alleged identity theft, not later than 4 business days after the date of receipt by such agency of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) appropriate proof of the identity of the consumer;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a copy of an identity theft report;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Notification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A consumer reporting agency shall promptly notify the furnisher of information identified by the consumer under subsection (a)&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A consumer reporting agency may decline to block, or may rescind any block, of information relating to a consumer under this section, if the consumer reporting agency reasonably determines that&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the information was blocked, or a block was requested by the consumer, on the basis of a material misrepresentation of fact by the consumer relevant to the request to block; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, if a consumer reporting agency rescinds a block, the presence of information in the file of a consumer prior to the blocking of such information is not evidence of whether the consumer knew or should have known that the consumer obtained possession of any goods, services, or money as a result of the block.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Exception for resellers</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) No reseller file</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">This section shall not apply to a consumer reporting agency, if the consumer reporting agency&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is a reseller;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) is not, at the time of the request of the consumer under subsection (a), otherwise furnishing or reselling a consumer report concerning the information identified by the consumer; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) informs the consumer, by any means, that the consumer may report the identity theft to the Bureau to obtain consumer information regarding identity theft.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Reseller with file</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The sole obligation of the consumer reporting agency under this section, with regard to any request of a consumer under this section, shall be to block the consumer report maintained by the consumer reporting agency from any subsequent use, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the consumer, in accordance with the provisions of subsection (a), identifies, to a consumer reporting agency, information in the file of the consumer that resulted from identity theft; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the consumer reporting agency is a reseller of the identified information.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Notice</h4>

Such notice shall contain the name, address, and telephone number of each consumer reporting agency from which the consumer information was obtained for resale.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Exception for verification companies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of this section do not apply to a check services company, acting as such, which issues authorizations for the purpose of approving or processing negotiable instruments, electronic fund transfers, or similar methods of payments, except that, beginning 4 business days after receipt of information described in paragraphs (1) through (3) of subsection (a), a check services company shall not report to a national consumer reporting agency described in section 1681a(p) of this title, any information identified in the subject identity theft report as resulting from identity theft.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Access to blocked information by law enforcement agencies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No provision of this section shall be construed as requiring a consumer reporting agency to prevent a Federal, State, or local law enforcement agency from accessing blocked information in a consumer file to which the agency could otherwise obtain access under this subchapter.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Disclosure of credit scores by certain mortgage lenders</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>

<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Notice under subparagraph (D)</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Disclosures in case of automated underwriting system</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If a person that is subject to this subsection uses an automated underwriting system to underwrite a loan, that person may satisfy the obligation to provide a credit score by disclosing a credit score and associated key factors supplied by a consumer reporting agency.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Numerical credit score</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">However, if a numerical credit score is generated by an automated underwriting system used by an enterprise, and that score is disclosed to the person, the score shall be disclosed to the consumer consistent with subparagraph (C).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Enterprise defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of this subparagraph, the term &quot;enterprise&quot; has the same meaning as in paragraph (6) of section 4502 of title 12.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Disclosures of credit scores not obtained from a consumer reporting agency</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A person that is subject to the provisions of this subsection and that uses a credit score, other than a credit score provided by a consumer reporting agency, may satisfy the obligation to provide a credit score by disclosing a credit score and associated key factors supplied by a consumer reporting agency.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">&quot;In connection with your application for a home loan, the lender must disclose to you the score that a consumer reporting agency distributed to users and the lender used in connection with your home loan, and the key factors affecting your credit scores.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">&quot;The credit score is a computer generated summary calculated at the time of the request and based on information that a consumer reporting agency or lender has on file. The scores are based on data about your credit history and payment patterns. Credit scores are important because they are used to assist the lender in determining whether you will obtain a loan. They may also be used to determine what interest rate you may be offered on the mortgage. Credit scores can change over time, depending on your conduct, how your credit history and payment patterns change, and how credit scoring technologies change.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">&quot;Because the score is based on information in your credit history, it is very important that you review the credit-related information that is being furnished to make sure it is accurate. Credit records may vary from one company to another.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">&quot;If you have questions about your credit score or the credit information that is furnished to you, contact the consumer reporting agency at the address and telephone number provided with this notice, or contact the lender, if the lender developed or generated the credit score. The consumer reporting agency plays no part in the decision to take any action on the loan application and is unable to provide you with specific reasons for the decision on a loan application.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">&quot;If you have questions concerning the terms of the loan, contact the lender.&quot;.</p>

<!-- PDFPage:1587 --><p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) provide the disclosure required by this subsection when another person has made the disclosure to the consumer for that loan transaction.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(F) No obligation for content</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The obligation of any person pursuant to this subsection shall be limited solely to providing a copy of the information that was received from the consumer reporting agency.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Limit on liability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">No person has liability under this subsection for the content of that information or for the omission of any information within the report provided by the consumer reporting agency.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(G) Person defined as excluding enterprise</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">As used in this subsection, the term &quot;person&quot; does not include an enterprise (as defined in paragraph (6) of section 4502 of title 12).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Prohibition on disclosure clauses null and void</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any provision in a contract that prohibits the disclosure of a credit score by a person who makes or arranges loans or a consumer reporting agency is void.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) No liability for disclosure under this subsection</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A lender shall not have liability under any contractual provision for disclosure of a credit score pursuant to this subsection.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Statement of Findings and Purpose for 2008 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 110&ndash;241, &sect;2, June 3, 2008, 122 Stat. 1565, provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Congress finds as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(1) The Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act [of 2003] (commonly referred to as &apos;FACTA&apos;) [Pub. L. 108&ndash;159, see Short Title of 2003 Amendment note set out under section 1601 of this title] was enacted into law in 2003 and 1 of the purposes of such Act is to prevent criminals from obtaining access to consumers&apos; private financial and credit information in order to reduce identity theft and credit card fraud.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(2) As part of that law, the Congress enacted a requirement, through an amendment to the Fair Credit Reporting Act [15 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.], that no person that accepts credit cards or debit cards for the transaction of business shall print more than the last 5 digits of the card number or the expiration date upon any receipt provided to the card holder at the point of the sale or transaction.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(3) Many merchants understood that this requirement would be satisfied by truncating the account <!-- PDFPage:1602 -->number down to the last 5 digits based in part on the language of the provision as well as the publicity in the aftermath of the passage of the law.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(4) Almost immediately after the deadline for compliance passed, hundreds of lawsuits were filed alleging that the failure to remove the expiration date was a willful violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act even where the account number was properly truncated.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(5) None of these lawsuits contained an allegation of harm to any consumer's identity.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(6) Experts in the field agree that proper truncation of the card number, by itself as required by the amendment made by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act [of 2003], regardless of the inclusion of the expiration date, prevents a potential fraudster from perpetrating identity theft or credit card fraud.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(7) Despite repeatedly being denied class certification, the continued appealing and filing of these lawsuits represents a significant burden on the hundreds of companies that have been sued and could well raise prices to consumers without corresponding consumer protection benefit.</p>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(b) <cap-smallcap>Purpose</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The purpose of this Act [amending this section and enacting provisions set out as notes under this section and section 1601 of this title] is to ensure that consumers suffering from any actual harm to their credit or identity are protected while simultaneously limiting abusive lawsuits that do not protect consumers but only result in increased cost to business and potentially increased prices to consumers.&quot;</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Retroactive Effect of 2008 Amendment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 110&ndash;241, &sect;3(b), June 3, 2008, 122 Stat. 1566, provided that: &quot;The amendment made by subsection (a) [amending this section] shall apply to any action, other than an action which has become final, that is brought for a violation of [section] 605(g) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act [15 U.S.C. 1681c(g)] to which such amendment applies without regard to whether such action is brought before or after the date of the enactment of this Act [June 3, 2008].&quot;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) whether direct contact by the consumer with the furnisher would likely result in the most expeditious resolution of any such dispute; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) complete such person's investigation of the dispute and report the results of the investigation to the consumer before the expiration of the period under section 1681i(a)(1) of this title within which a consumer reporting agency would be required to complete its action if the consumer had elected to dispute the information under that section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) if the investigation finds that the information reported was inaccurate, promptly notify each consumer reporting agency to which the person furnished the inaccurate information of that determination and provide to the agency any correction to that information that is necessary to make the information provided by the person accurate.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(F) Frivolous or irrelevant dispute</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">This paragraph shall not apply if the person receiving a notice of a dispute from a consumer reasonably determines that the dispute is frivolous or irrelevant, including&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex or marital status, or age (provided the applicant has the capacity to contract);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) because all or part of the applicant's income derives from any public assistance program; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) because the applicant has in good faith exercised any right under this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Activities not constituting discrimination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It shall not constitute discrimination for purposes of this subchapter for a creditor&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to make an inquiry of marital status if such inquiry is for the purpose of ascertaining the creditor's rights and remedies applicable to the particular extension of credit and not to discriminate in a determination of credit-worthiness;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to make an inquiry of the applicant's age or of whether the applicant's income derives from any public assistance program if such inquiry is for the purpose of determining the amount and probable continuance of income levels, credit history, or other pertinent element of credit-worthiness as provided in regulations of the Bureau;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to use any empirically derived credit system which considers age if such system is demonstrably and statistically sound in accordance with regulations of the Bureau, except that in the operation of such system the age of an elderly applicant may not be assigned a negative factor or value;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to make an inquiry or to consider the age of an elderly applicant when the age of such applicant is to be used by the creditor in the extension of credit in favor of such applicant; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) providing statements of reasons in writing as a matter of course to applicants against whom adverse action is taken; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) giving written notification of adverse action which discloses (i) the applicant's right to a statement of reasons within thirty days after receipt by the creditor of a request made within sixty days after such notification, and (ii) the identity of the person or office from which such statement may be obtained. Such statement may be given orally if the written notification advises the applicant of his right to have the statement of reasons confirmed in writing on written request.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A statement of reasons meets the requirements of this section only if it contains the specific reasons for the adverse action taken.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Where a creditor has been requested by a third party to make a specific extension of credit directly or indirectly to an applicant, the notification and statement of reasons required by this subsection may be made directly by such creditor, or indirectly through the third party, provided in either case that the identity of the creditor is disclosed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The requirements of paragraph (2), (3), or (4) may be satisfied by verbal statements or notifications in the case of any creditor who did not act on more than one hundred and fifty applications during the calendar year preceding the calendar year in which the adverse action is taken, as determined under regulations of the Bureau.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) For purposes of this subsection, the term &quot;adverse action&quot; means a denial or revocation of credit, a change in the terms of an existing credit arrangement, or a refusal to grant credit in substantially the amount or on substantially the terms requested. Such term does not include a refusal to extend additional credit under an existing credit arrangement where the applicant is delinquent or otherwise in default, or where such additional credit would exceed a previously established credit limit.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Copies furnished to applicants</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Waiver</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The applicant may waive the 3 day requirement provided for in paragraph (1), except where otherwise required in law.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Reimbursement</h4>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Requests for signature of husband and wife for creation of valid lien, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A request for the signature of both parties to a marriage for the purpose of creating a valid lien, passing clear title, waiving inchoate rights to property, or assigning earnings, shall not constitute discrimination under this subchapter: <i>Provided, however</i>, That this provision shall not be construed to permit a creditor to take sex or marital status into account in connection with the evaluation of creditworthiness of any applicant.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) State property laws affecting creditworthiness</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Consideration or application of State property laws directly or indirectly affecting creditworthiness shall not constitute discrimination for purposes of this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) State laws prohibiting separate extension of consumer credit to husband and wife</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any provision of State law which prohibits the separate extension of consumer credit to each party to a marriage shall not apply in any case where each party to a marriage voluntarily applies for separate credit from the same creditor: <i>Provided</i>, That in any case where such a State law is so preempted, each party to the marriage shall be solely responsible for the debt so contracted.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Combining credit accounts of husband and wife with same creditor to determine permissible finance charges or loan ceilings under Federal or State laws</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When each party to a marriage separately and voluntarily applies for and obtains separate credit accounts with the same creditor, those accounts shall not be aggregated or otherwise combined for purposes of determining permissible finance charges or permissible loan ceilings under the laws of any State or of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Election of remedies under subchapter or State law; nature of relief determining applicability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Where the same act or omission constitutes a violation of this subchapter and of applicable State law, a person aggrieved by such conduct may bring a legal action to recover monetary damages either under this subchapter or under such State law, but not both. This election of remedies shall not apply to court actions in which the relief sought does not include monetary damages or to administrative actions.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Compliance with inconsistent State laws; determination of inconsistency</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This subchapter does not annul, alter, or affect, or exempt any person subject to the provisions of this subchapter from complying with, the laws of any State with respect to credit discrimination, except to the extent that those laws are inconsistent with any provision of this subchapter, and then only to the extent of the inconsistency. The Bureau is authorized to determine whether such inconsistencies exist. The Bureau may not determine that any State law is inconsistent with any provision of this subchapter if the Bureau determines that such law gives greater protection to the applicant.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Exemption by regulation of credit transactions covered by State law; failure to comply with State law</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Bureau shall by regulation exempt from the requirements of sections 1691 and 1691a of <!-- PDFPage:1632 -->this title any class of credit transactions within any State if it determines that under the law of that State that class of transactions is subject to requirements substantially similar to those imposed under this subchapter or that such law gives greater protection to the applicant, and that there is adequate provision for enforcement. Failure to comply with any requirement of such State law in any transaction so exempted shall constitute a violation of this subchapter for the purposes of section 1691e of this title.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Abusive practices</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There is abundant evidence of the use of abusive, deceptive, and unfair debt collection practices by many debt collectors. Abusive debt collection practices contribute to the number of personal bankruptcies, to marital instability, to the loss of jobs, and to invasions of individual privacy.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Inadequacy of laws</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Existing laws and procedures for redressing these injuries are inadequate to protect consumers.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Available non-abusive collection methods</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Means other than misrepresentation or other abusive debt collection practices are available for the effective collection of debts.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Interstate commerce</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Abusive debt collection practices are carried on to a substantial extent in interstate commerce and through means and instrumentalities of such commerce. Even where abusive debt collection practices are purely intrastate in character, they nevertheless directly affect interstate commerce.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the purpose of this subchapter to eliminate abusive debt collection practices by debt collectors, to insure that those debt collectors who refrain from using abusive debt collection practices are not competitively disadvantaged, and to promote consistent State action to protect consumers against debt collection abuses.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Rights and liabilities undefined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that the use of electronic systems to transfer funds provides the potential for substantial benefits to consumers. However, due to the unique characteristics of such systems, the application of existing consumer protection legislation is unclear, leaving the rights and liabilities of consumers, financial institutions, and intermediaries in electronic fund transfers undefined.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the purpose of this subchapter to provide a basic framework establishing the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of participants in electronic fund and remittance transfer systems. The primary objective of this subchapter, however, is the provision of individual consumer rights.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Prescription by the Bureau and the Board</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (2), the Bureau shall prescribe rules to carry out the purposes of this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Authority of the Board</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2)&#160;<sup><a href="#1693b_1_target" name="1693b_1">1</a></sup> prepare an analysis of economic impact which considers the costs and benefits to financial institutions, consumers, and other users of electronic fund transfers, including the extent to which additional documentation, reports, records, or other paper work would be required, and the effects upon competition in the provision of electronic banking services among large and small financial institutions and the availability of such services to different classes of consumers, particularly low income consumers,</p>

Such model clauses shall be adopted after notice duly given in the Federal Register and opportunity for public comment in accordance with section 553 of title 5. With respect to the disclosures required by section 1693c(a)(3) and (4) of this title, the Bureau shall take account of variations in the services and charges under different electronic fund transfer systems and, as appropriate, shall issue alternative model clauses for disclosure of these differing account terms.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Prohibition on fees not properly disclosed and explicitly assumed by consumer</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">No fee may be imposed by any automated teller machine operator in connection with any electronic fund transfer initiated by a consumer for which a notice is required under subparagraph (A), unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the consumer receives such notice in accordance with subparagraph (B); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the consumer elects to continue in the manner necessary to effect the transaction after receiving such notice.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The terms and conditions of electronic fund transfers involving a consumer's account shall be disclosed at the time the consumer contracts for an electronic fund transfer service, in accordance with regulations of the Bureau. Such disclosures shall be in readily understandable language and shall include, to the extent applicable&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the consumer's liability for unauthorized electronic fund transfers and, at the financial institution's option, notice of the advisability of prompt reporting of any loss, theft, or unauthorized use of a card, code, or other means of access;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the telephone number and address of the person or office to be notified in the event the consumer believes than&#160;<sup><a href="#1693c_1_target" name="1693c_1">1</a></sup> an unauthorized electronic fund transfer has been or may be effected;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the type and nature of electronic fund transfers which the consumer may initiate, including any limitations on the frequency or dollar amount of such transfers, except that the details of such limitations need not be disclosed if their confidentiality is necessary to maintain the security of an electronic fund transfer system, as determined by the Bureau;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the consumer's right to stop payment of a preauthorized electronic fund transfer and the procedure to initiate such a stop payment order;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the consumer's right to receive documentation of electronic fund transfers under section 1693d of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) a summary, in a form prescribed by regulations of the Bureau, of the error resolution provisions of section 1693f of this title and the consumer's rights thereunder.

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Notification to financial institution of error</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a financial institution, within sixty days after having transmitted to a consumer documentation pursuant to section 1693d(a), (c), or (d) of this title or notification pursuant to section 1693d(b) of this title, receives oral or written notice in which the consumer&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) sets forth or otherwise enables the financial institution to identify the name and account number of the consumer;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) indicates the consumer's belief that the documentation, or, in the case of notification pursuant to section 1693d(b) of this title, the consumer's account, contains an error and the amount of such error; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) sets forth the reasons for the consumer's belief (where applicable) that an error has occurred,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the financial institution shall investigate the alleged error, determine whether an error has occurred, and report or mail the results of such investigation and determination to the consumer within ten business days. The financial institution may require written confirmation to be provided to it within ten business days of an oral notification of error if, when the oral notification is made, the consumer is advised of such requirement and the address to which such confirmation should be sent. A financial institution which requires written confirmation in accordance with the previous sentence need not provisionally recredit a consumer's account in accordance with subsection (c), nor shall the financial institution be liable under subsection (e) if the written confirmation is not received within the ten-day period referred to in the previous sentence.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Correction of error; interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the financial institution determines that an error did occur, it shall promptly, but in no event more than one business day after such determination, correct the error, subject to section 1693g of this title, including the crediting of interest where applicable.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Provisional recredit of consumer's account</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a financial institution receives notice of an error in the manner and within the time period specified in subsection (a), it may, in lieu of the requirements of subsections (a) and (b), within ten business days after receiving such notice provisionally recredit the consumer's account for the amount alleged to be in error, subject to section 1693g of this title, including interest where applicable, pending the conclusion of its investigation and its determination of whether an error has occurred. Such investigation shall be concluded not later than forty-five days after receipt of notice of the error. During the pendency of the investigation, the consumer shall have full use of the funds provisionally recredited.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Absence of error; finding; explanation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the financial institution determines after its investigation pursuant to subsection (a) or (c) that an error did not occur, it shall deliver or mail to the consumer an explanation of its findings within 3 business days after the conclusion of its investigation, and upon request of the consumer promptly deliver or mail to the consumer reproductions of all documents which the financial institution relied on to conclude that such error did not occur. The financial institution shall include notice of the right to request reproductions with the explanation of its findings.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Treble damages</h4>
<p class="statutory-body"> If in any action under section 1693m&#160;<sup><a href="#1693f_1_target" name="1693f_1">1</a></sup> of this title, the court finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the financial institution did not provisionally recredit a consumer's account within the ten-day period specified in subsection (c), and the financial institution (A) did not make a good faith investigation of the alleged error, or (B) did not have a reasonable basis for believing that the consumer's account was not in error; or</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Unauthorized electronic fund transfers; limit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A consumer shall be liable for any unauthorized electronic fund transfer involving the account of such consumer only if the card or other means of access utilized for such transfer was an accepted card or other meanas&#160;<sup><a href="#1693g_1_target" name="1693g_1">1</a></sup> of access and if the issuer of such card, code, or other means of access has provided a means whereby the user of such card, code, or other means of access can be identified as the person authorized to use it, such as by signature, photograph, or fingerprint or by electronic or mechanical confirmation. In no event, however, shall a consumer's liability for an unauthorized transfer exceed the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) $50; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the amount of money or value of property or services obtained in such unauthorized electronic fund transfer prior to the time the financial institution is notified of, or otherwise becomes aware of, circumstances which lead to the reasonable belief that an unauthorized electronic fund transfer involving the consumer's account has been or may be effected. Notice under this paragraph is sufficient when such steps have been taken as may be reasonably required in the ordinary course of business to provide the financial institution with the pertinent information, whether or not any particular officer, employee, or agent of the financial institution does in fact receive such information.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Notwithstanding the foregoing, reimbursement need not be made to the consumer for losses the financial institution establishes would not have occurred but for the failure of the consumer to report within sixty days of transmittal of the statement (or in extenuating circumstances such as extended travel or hospitalization, within a reasonable time under the circumstances) any unauthorized electronic fund transfer or account error which appears on the periodic statement provided to the consumer under section 1693d of this title. In addition, reimbursement need not be made to the consumer for losses which the financial institution establishes would not have occurred but for the failure of the consumer to report any loss or theft of a card or other means of access within two business days after the consumer learns of the loss or theft (or in extenuating circumstances such as extended travel or hospitalization, within a longer period which is reasonable under the circumstances), but the consumer's liability under this subsection in any such case may not exceed a total of $500, or the amount of unauthorized electronic fund transfers which occur following the close of two business days (or such longer period) after the consumer learns of the loss or theft but prior to notice to the financial institution under this subsection, whichever is less.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Burden of proof</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any action which involves a consumer's liability for an unauthorized electronic fund transfer, the burden of proof is upon the financial institution to show that the electronic fund transfer was authorized or, if the electronic fund transfer was unauthorized, then the burden of proof is upon the financial institution to establish that the conditions of liability set forth in subsection (a) have been met, and, if the transfer was initiated after the effective date of section 1693c of this title, that the disclosures required to be made to the consumer under section 1693c(a)(1) and (2) of this title were in fact made in accordance with such section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Determination of limitation on liability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the event of a transaction which involves both an unauthorized electronic fund transfer and an extension of credit as defined in section 1602(e)&#160;<sup><a href="#1693g_2_target" name="1693g_2">2</a></sup> of this title pursuant to an agreement between the consumer and the financial institution to extend such credit to the consumer in the event the consumer's account is overdrawn, the limitation on the consumer's liability for such transaction shall be determined solely in accordance with this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Restriction on liability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section imposes liability upon a consumer for an unauthorized electronic fund transfer in excess of his liability for such a transfer under other applicable law or under any agreement with the consumer's financial institution.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Scope of liability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in this section, a consumer incurs no liability from an unauthorized electronic fund transfer.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Acts of God and technical malfunctions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A financial institution shall not be liable under subsection (a)(1) or (2) if the financial institution shows by a preponderance of the evidence that its action or failure to act resulted from&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) an act of God or other circumstance beyond its control, that it exercised reasonable care to prevent such an occurrence, and that it exercised such diligence as the circumstances required; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a technical malfunction which was known to the consumer at the time he attempted to initiate an electronic fund transfer or, in the case of a preauthorized transfer, at the time such transfer should have occurred.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Intent</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of a failure described in subsection (a) which was not intentional and which resulted from a bona fide error, notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to avoid any such error, the financial institution shall be liable for actual damages proved.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Exception for damaged notices</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the notice required to be posted pursuant to section 1693b(d)(3)(B)(i) of this title by an automated teller machine operator has been posted by such operator in compliance with such section and the notice is subsequently removed, damaged, or altered by any person other than the operator of the automated teller machine, the operator shall have no liability under this section for failure to comply with section 1693b(d)(3)(B)(i) of this title.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Reasonable interchange transaction fees for electronic debit transactions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Regulatory authority over interchange transaction fees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Board may prescribe regulations, pursuant to section 553 of title 5, regarding any interchange transaction fee that an issuer may receive or charge with respect to an electronic debit transaction, to implement this subsection (including related definitions), and to prevent circumvention or evasion of this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Reasonable interchange transaction fees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The amount of any interchange transaction fee that an issuer may receive or charge with respect to an electronic debit transaction shall be reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by the issuer with respect to the transaction.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Rulemaking required</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Board shall prescribe regulations in final form not later than 9 months after July 21, 2010, to establish standards for assessing whether the amount of any interchange transaction fee described in paragraph (2) is reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by the issuer with respect to the transaction.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Information collection</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Board may require any issuer (or agent of an issuer) or payment card network to provide the Board with such information as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this subsection and the Board, in issuing rules under subparagraph (A) and on at least a bi-annual basis thereafter, shall disclose such aggregate or summary information concerning the costs incurred, and interchange transaction fees charged or received, by issuers or payment card networks in connection with the authorization, clearance or settlement of electronic debit transactions as the Board considers appropriate and in the public interest.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Considerations; consultation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In prescribing regulations under paragraph (3)(A), the Board shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) consider the functional similarity between&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) electronic debit transactions; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) checking transactions that are required within the Federal Reserve bank system to clear at par;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) distinguish between&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the incremental cost incurred by an issuer for the role of the issuer in the authorization, clearance, or settlement of a particular electronic debit transaction, which cost shall be considered under paragraph (2); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) other costs incurred by an issuer which are not specific to a particular electronic debit transaction, which costs shall not be considered under paragraph (2); and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) consult, as appropriate, with the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Directors of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Director of the Office of Thrift Supervision, the National Credit Union Administration Board, the Administrator of the Small Business Administration, and the Director of the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Adjustments to interchange transaction fees for fraud prevention costs</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Adjustments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Board may allow for an adjustment to the fee amount received or charged by an issuer under paragraph (2), if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) such adjustment is reasonably necessary to make allowance for costs incurred by the issuer in preventing fraud in relation to electronic debit transactions involving that issuer; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the issuer complies with the fraud-related standards established by the Board under subparagraph (B), which standards shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) be designed to ensure that any fraud-related adjustment of the issuer is limited to the amount described in clause (i) and takes into account any fraud-related reimbursements (including amounts from charge-backs) received from consumers, merchants, or payment card networks in relation to electronic debit transactions involving the issuer; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) require issuers to take effective steps to reduce the occurrence of, and costs from, fraud in relation to electronic debit transactions, including through the development and implementation of cost-effective fraud prevention technology.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Rulemaking required</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Board shall prescribe regulations in final form not later than 9 months after July 21, 2010, to establish standards for making adjustments under this paragraph.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) the available and economical means by which fraud on electronic debit transactions may be reduced;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(IV) the fraud prevention and data security costs expended by each party involved in electronic debit transactions (including consumers, persons who accept debit cards as a form of payment, financial institutions, retailers and payment card networks);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(V) the costs of fraudulent transactions absorbed by each party involved <!-- PDFPage:1663 -->in such transactions (including consumers, persons who accept debit cards as a form of payment, financial institutions, retailers and payment card networks);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(VI) the extent to which interchange transaction fees have in the past reduced or increased incentives for parties involved in electronic debit transactions to reduce fraud on such transactions; and</p>

A State law is not inconsistent with this subchapter if the protection such law affords any consumer is greater than the protection afforded by this subchapter. The Bureau shall, upon its own motion or upon the request of any financial institution, State, or other interested party, submitted in accordance with procedures prescribed in regulations of the Bureau, determine whether a State requirement is inconsistent or affords greater protection. If the Bureau determines that a State requirement is inconsistent, financial institutions shall incur no liability under the law of that State for a good faith failure to comply with that law, notwithstanding that such determination is subsequently amended, rescinded, or determined by judicial or other authority to be invalid for any reason. This subchapter does not extend the applicability of any such law to any class of persons or transactions to which it would not otherwise apply.</p>
