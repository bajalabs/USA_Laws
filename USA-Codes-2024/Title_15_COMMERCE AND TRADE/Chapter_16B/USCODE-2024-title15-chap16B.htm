<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Objectives</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress hereby declares that the general welfare and the common defense and security require positive and effective action to conserve scarce energy supplies, to insure fair and efficient distribution of, and the maintenance of fair and reasonable consumer prices for, such supplies, to promote the expansion of readily usable energy sources, and to assist in developing policies and plans to meet the energy needs of the Nation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Necessity for reorganization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that to help achieve these objectives, and to assure a coordinated and effective approach to overcoming energy shortages, it is necessary to reorganize certain agencies and functions of the executive branch and to establish a Federal Energy Administration.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Creation of Federal Energy Administration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The sole purpose of this chapter is to create an administration in the executive branch, called the Federal Energy Administration, to vest in the Administration certain functions as provided in this chapter, and to transfer to such Administration certain executive branch functions authorized by other laws, where such transfer is necessary on an interim basis to deal with the Nation's energy shortages.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Limitation on discretionary powers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to the provisions and procedures set forth in this chapter, the Administrator shall be responsible for such actions as are taken to assure that adequate provision is made to meet the energy needs of the Nation. To that end, he shall make such plans and direct and conduct such programs related to the production, conservation, use, control, distribution, rationing, and allocation of all forms of energy as are appropriate in connection with only those authorities or functions&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) specifically transferred to or vested in him by or pursuant to this chapter;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) assess the adequacy of energy resources to meet demands in the immediate and longer range future for all sectors of the economy and for the general public;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) develop effective arrangements for the participation of State and local governments in the resolution of energy problems;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) develop plans and programs for dealing with energy production shortages;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) promote stability in energy prices to the consumer, promote free and open competition in all aspects of the energy field, prevent unreasonable profits within the various segments of the energy industry, and promote free enterprise;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) assure that energy programs are designed and implemented in a fair and efficient manner so as to minimize hardship and inequity while assuring that the priority needs of the Nation are met;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) develop and oversee the implementation of equitable voluntary and mandatory energy conservation programs and promote efficiencies in the use of energy resources;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) develop and recommend policies on the import and export of energy resources;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Exercise of delegated discretion concerning exemptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Administrator shall not exercise the discretion delegated to him by the President, pursuant to section 754(b)&#160;<sup><a href="#764_1_target" name="764_1">1</a></sup> of this title, to submit to the Congress as one energy action any amendment to the regulation under section 753(a)&#160;<sup><a href="#764_1_target" name="764_1">1</a></sup> of this title, pursuant to section 760a&#160;<sup><a href="#764_1_target" name="764_1">1</a></sup> of this title, which amendment exempts any oil, refined petroleum product, or refined product category from both the allocation and pricing provisions of the regulation under section 753&#160;<sup><a href="#764_1_target" name="764_1">1</a></sup> of this title.</p>
