<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(1) the United States steel industry has been severely harmed by a record surge of more than 40,000,000 tons of steel imports into the United States since 1998, caused by the world financial crisis;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(2) this surge in imports resulted in the loss of more than 10,000 steel worker jobs since 1998, and was the imminent cause of three bankruptcies by medium-sized steel companies, Acme Steel, Laclede Steel, and Geneva Steel;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(3) the crisis also forced almost all United States steel companies into&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&quot;(A) reduced volume, lower prices, and financial losses; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&quot;(B) an inability to obtain credit for continued operations and reinvestment in facilities;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(4) the crisis also has affected the willingness of private banks and investment institutions to make loans to the United States steel industry for continued operation and reinvestment in facilities;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(5) these steel bankruptcies, job losses, and financial losses are also having serious negative effects on the tax base of cities, counties, and States, and on the essential health, education, and municipal services that these government entities provide to their citizens; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(6) a strong steel industry is necessary to the adequate defense preparedness of the United States in order to have sufficient steel available to build the ships, tanks, planes, and armaments necessary for the national defense.</p>

<p class="note-body">&quot;(b) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Congress finds that&mdash;</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(2) the number of oil and gas rigs operating in the United States is at its lowest since 1944, when records of this tally began;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(3) if prices do not increase soon, the United States could lose at least half its marginal wells, which in aggregate produce as much oil as the United States imports from Saudi Arabia;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(4) oil and gas prices are unlikely to increase for at least several years;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(5) declining production, well abandonment, and greatly reduced exploration and development are shrinking the domestic oil and gas industry;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(6) the world's richest oil producing regions in the Middle East are experiencing increasingly greater political instability;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(7) United Nations policy may make Iraq the swing oil producing nation, thereby granting Saddam Hussein tremendous power;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(8) reliance on foreign oil for more than 60 percent of our daily oil and gas consumption is a national security threat;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(9) the level of United States oil security is directly related to the level of domestic production of oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(10) a national security policy should be developed that ensures that adequate supplies of oil are available at all times free of the threat of embargo or other foreign hostile acts.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) Loans guaranteed under this chapter shall bear interest payable to the lending institutions at rates determined by the Board taking into account the reduction in risk afforded by the loan guarantee and rates charged by lending institutions on otherwise comparable loans.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Board shall prescribe and collect a guarantee fee in connection with each loan guaranteed under this chapter. Such fee shall reflect the Government's administrative expense in making the guarantee and the risk assumed by the Government and shall not be less than an amount which, when added to the amount of interest payable to the lender of such loan, produces a total charge appropriate for loan agreements of comparable risk and maturity if supplied by the normal capital markets.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Stock dividends or other payments, prohibition; waiver</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A guarantee agreement made under this chapter with respect to an enterprise shall require that while there is any principal or interest remaining unpaid on a guaranteed loan to that enterprise the enterprise may not&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) declare a dividend on its common stock; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) make any payment on its other indebtedness to a lender whose loan has been guaranteed under this chapter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Board may waive either or both of the requirements set forth in this subsection, as specified in the guarantee agreement covering a loan to any particular enterprise, if it determines that such waiver is not inconsistent with the reasonable protection of the interests of the United States under the guarantee.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Managerial changes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Board determines that the inability of an enterprise to obtain credit without a guarantee under this chapter is the result of a failure on the part of management to exercise reasonable business prudence in the conduct of the affairs of the enterprise, the Board shall require before guaranteeing any loan to the enterprise that the enterprise make such management changes as the Board deems necessary to give the enterprise a sound managerial base.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Financial statement; access to documents</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A guarantee of a loan to any enterprise shall not be made under this chapter unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the Board has received an audited financial statement of the enterprise; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the enterprise permits the Board to have the same access to its books and other documents as the Board would have under section 1846 of this title in the event the loan is guaranteed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Exhaustion of remedies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No payment shall be made or become due under a guarantee entered into under this chapter unless the lender has exhausted any remedies which it may have under the guarantee agreement.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Protective provisions; advances</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Prior to making any guarantee under this chapter, the Board shall satisfy itself that the underlying loan agreement on which the guarantee is sought contains all the affirmative and negative covenants and other protective provisions which are usual and customary in loan agreements of a similar kind, including previous loan agreements between the lender and the borrower, and that it cannot be amended, or any provisions waived, without the Board's prior consent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) On each occasion when the borrower seeks an advance under the loan agreement, the guarantee authorized by this chapter shall be in force as to the funds advanced only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the lender gives the Board at least ten days&apos; notice in writing of its intent to provide the borrower with funds pursuant to the loan agreement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the lender certifies to the Board before an advance is made that, as of the date of the notice provided for in subparagraph (A), the borrower is not in default under the loan agreement: <i>Provided</i>, That if a default has occurred the lender shall report the facts and circumstances relating thereto to the Board and the Board may expressly and in writing waive such default in any case where it determines that such waiver is not inconsistent with the reasonable protection of the interests of the United States under the guarantee; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the borrower provides the Board with a plan setting forth the expenditures for which the advance will be used and the period during which the expenditures will be made, and, <!-- PDFPage:1693 -->upon the expiration of such periods, reports to the Board any instances in which amounts advanced have not been expended in accordance with the plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Loan security, priority; collateral</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A guarantee agreement made under this chapter shall contain a requirement that as between the Board and the lender, the Board shall have a priority with respect to, and to the extent of, the lender's interest in any collateral securing the loan and any earlier outstanding loans. The Board shall take all steps necessary to assure such priority against any other persons.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) As used in paragraph (1) of this subsection, the term &quot;collateral&quot; includes all assets pledged under loan agreements and, if appropriate in the opinion of the Board, all sums of the borrower on deposit with the lender and subject to offset under section 68 of the Bankruptcy Act.</p>
