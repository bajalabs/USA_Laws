<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Congress finds and declares the following:</p>
<!-- PDFPage:651 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The future well-being of the United States economy depends on a strong manufacturing base and requires continual improvements in manufacturing technology, quality control, and techniques for ensuring product reliability and cost-effectiveness.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Precise measurements, calibrations, and standards help United States industry and manufacturing concerns compete strongly in world markets.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Improvements in manufacturing and product technology depend on fundamental scientific and engineering research to develop (A) the precise and accurate measurement methods and measurement standards needed to improve quality and reliability, and (B) new technological processes by which such improved methods may be used in practice to improve manufacturing and to assist industry to transfer important laboratory discoveries into commercial products.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Scientific progress, public safety, and product compatibility and standardization also depend on the development of precise measurement methods, standards, and related basic technologies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The National Bureau of Standards since its establishment has served as the Federal focal point in developing basic measurement standards and related technologies, has taken a lead role in stimulating cooperative work among private industrial organizations in efforts to surmount technological hurdles, and otherwise has been responsible for assisting in the improvement of industrial technology.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The Federal Government should maintain a national science, engineering, and technology laboratory which provides measurement methods, standards, and associated technologies and which aids United States companies in using new technologies to improve products and manufacturing processes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Such national laboratory also should serve industry, trade associations, State technology programs, labor organizations, professional societies, and educational institutions by disseminating information on new basic technologies including automated manufacturing processes.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) It is the purpose of this chapter&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to rename the National Bureau of Standards as the National Institute of Standards and Technology and to modernize and restructure that agency to augment its unique ability to enhance the competitiveness of American industry while maintaining its traditional function as lead national laboratory for providing the measurements, calibrations, and quality assurance techniques which underpin United States commerce, technological progress, improved product reliability and manufacturing processes, and public safety;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to assist private sector initiatives to capitalize on advanced technology;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to advance, through cooperative efforts among industries, universities, and government laboratories, promising research and development projects, which can be optimized by the private sector for commercial and industrial applications; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to promote shared risks, accelerated development, and pooling of skills which will be necessary to strengthen America's manufacturing industries.</p>

<h4 class="note-sub-head">&quot;SEC. 2. FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&quot;The Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(1) Over 90 percent of United States companies engaged in manufacturing are small- and medium-sized businesses.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(2) Most of these manufacturers produce goods for assemblage into products of large companies.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(3) The emergence of the World Wide Web and the promulgation of international standards for product data exchange greatly accelerated the movement toward electronically integrated supply chains during the last half of the 1990's.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(4) European and Asian countries are investing heavily in electronic enterprise standards development, and in preparing their smaller manufacturers to do business in the new environment. European efforts are well advanced in the aerospace, automotive, and shipbuilding industries and are beginning in other industries including home building, furniture manufacturing, textiles, and apparel. This investment could give overseas companies a major competitive advantage.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(5) The National Institute of Standards and Technology, because of the electronic commerce expertise in its laboratories and quality program, its long history of working cooperatively with manufacturers, and the nationwide reach of its manufacturing extension program, is in a unique position to help United States large and smaller manufacturers alike in their responses to this challenge.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(6) It is, therefore, in the national interest for the National Institute of Standards and Technology to accelerate its efforts in helping industry develop standards and enterprise integration processes that are necessary to increase efficiency and lower costs.</p>

<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 111&ndash;358, title VII, &sect;702, Jan. 4, 2011, 124 Stat. 4041, provided that: &quot;Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(1) Over its 20-year existence, the Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership has proven its value to manufacturers as demonstrated by the resulting impact on jobs and the economies of all 50 States and the Nation as a whole.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(2) The Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership has helped thousands of companies reinvest in themselves through process improvement and business growth initiatives leading to more sales, new markets, and the adoption of technology to deliver new products and services.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(3) Manufacturing is an increasingly important part of the construction sector as the industry moves to the use of more components and factory built sub-assemblies.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(4) Construction practices must become more efficient and precise if the United States is to construct <!-- PDFPage:690 -->and renovate its building stock to reduce related carbon emissions to levels that are consistent with combating global warming.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(5) Many companies involved in construction are small, without access to innovative manufacturing techniques, and could benefit from the type of training and business analysis activities that the Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership routinely provides to the Nation's manufacturers and their supply chains.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(6) Broadening the competitiveness grant program under [former] section 25(f) of the National Institute of Standards and Technology Act ([former] 15 U.S.C. 278k(f), now see 15 U.S.C. 278k&ndash;1) could help develop and diffuse knowledge necessary to capture a large portion of the estimated $100 billion or more in energy savings if buildings in the United States met the level and quality of energy efficiency now found in buildings in certain other countries.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(7) It is therefore in the national interest to expand the capabilities of the Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership to be supportive of the construction and green energy industries.&quot;</p>
