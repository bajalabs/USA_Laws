<h3 class="section-head">&sect;631. Declaration of policy</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Aid, counsel, assistance, etc., to small business concerns</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The essence of the American economic system of private enterprise is free competition. Only through full and free competition can free markets, free entry into business, and opportunities for the expression and growth of personal initiative and individual judgment be assured. The preservation and expansion of such competition is basic not only to the economic well-being but to the security of this Nation. Such security and well-being cannot be realized unless the actual and potential capacity of small business is encouraged and developed. It is the declared policy of the Congress that the Government should aid, <!-- PDFPage:749 -->counsel, assist, and protect, insofar as is possible, the interests of small-business concerns in order to preserve free competitive enterprise, to insure that a fair proportion of the total purchases and contracts or subcontracts for property and services for the Government (including but not limited to contracts or subcontracts for maintenance, repair, and construction) be placed with small-business enterprises, to insure that a fair proportion of the total sales of Government property be made to such enterprises, and to maintain and strengthen the overall economy of the Nation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Assistance to compete in international markets</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) It is the declared policy of the Congress that the Federal Government, through the Administrator of the Small Business Administration, acting through the Associate Administrator for International Trade, and in cooperation with the Department of Commerce and other relevant State and Federal agencies, should aid and assist small businesses, as defined under this chapter, to increase their ability to compete in international markets by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) enhancing their ability to export;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) facilitating technology transfers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) enhancing their ability to compete effectively and efficiently against imports;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) increasing the access of small businesses to long-term capital for the purchase of new plant and equipment used in the production of goods and services involved in international trade;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) disseminating information concerning State, Federal, and private programs and initiatives to enhance the ability of small businesses to compete in international markets; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) ensuring that the interests of small businesses are adequately represented in bilateral and multilateral trade negotiations.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Congress recognizes that the Department of Commerce is the principal Federal agency for trade development and export promotion and that the Department of Commerce and the Small Business Administration work together to advance joint interests. It is the purpose of this chapter to enhance, not alter, their respective roles.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Aid for agriculturally related industries; financial assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the declared policy of the Congress that the Government, through the Small Business Administration, should aid and assist small business concerns which are engaged in the production of food and fiber, ranching, and raising of livestock, aquaculture, and all other farming and agricultural related industries; and the financial assistance programs authorized by this chapter are also to be used to assist such concerns.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Use of assistance programs to establish, preserve, and strengthen small business concerns</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The assistance programs authorized by sections 636(i) and 636(j) of this title are to be utilized to assist in the establishment, preservation, and strengthening of small business concerns and improve the managerial skills employed in such enterprises, with special attention to small business concerns (1) located in urban or rural areas with high proportions of unemployed or low-income individuals; or (2) owned by low-income individuals; and to mobilize for these objectives private as well as public managerial skills and resources.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) With respect to the programs authorized by section 636(j) of this title, the Congress finds&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) that ownership and control of productive capital is concentrated in the economy of the United States and certain groups, therefore, own and control little productive capital;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) that certain groups in the United States own and control little productive capital because they have limited opportunities for small business ownership;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) that the broadening of small business ownership among groups that presently own and control little productive capital is essential to provide for the well-being of this Nation by promoting their increased participation in the free enterprise system of the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) that such development of business ownership among groups that presently own and control little productive capital will be greatly facilitated through the creation of a small business ownership development program, which shall provide services, including, but not limited to, financial, management, and technical assistance.<sup><a href="#631_1_target" name="631_1">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) that the power to let Federal contracts pursuant to section 637(a) of this title can be an effective procurement assistance tool for development of business ownership among groups that own and control little productive capital; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(vi) that the procurement authority under section 637(a) of this title shall be used only as a tool for developing business ownership among groups that own and control little productive capital.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) It is therefore the purpose of the programs authorized by section 636(j) of this title to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) foster business ownership and development by individuals in groups that own and control little productive capital; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) promote the competitive viability of such firms in the marketplace by creating a small business and capital ownership development program to provide such available financial, technical, and management assistance as may be necessary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Assistance to victims of floods, etc., and those displaced as result of federally aided construction programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Further, it is the declared policy of the Congress that the Government should aid and assist victims of floods and other catastrophes, and small-business concerns which are displaced as a result of federally aided construction programs.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Findings; purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) with&#160;<sup><a href="#631_2_target" name="631_2">2</a></sup> respect to the Administration's business development programs the Congress finds&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:750 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) that the opportunity for full participation in our free enterprise system by socially and economically disadvantaged persons is essential if we are to obtain social and economic equality for such persons and improve the functioning of our national economy;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) that many such persons are socially disadvantaged because of their identification as members of certain groups that have suffered the effects of discriminatory practices or similar invidious circumstances over which they have no control;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) that such groups include, but are not limited to, Black Americans, Hispanic Americans, Native Americans, Indian tribes, Asian Pacific Americans, Native Hawaiian Organizations, and other minorities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) that it is in the national interest to expeditiously ameliorate the conditions of socially and economically disadvantaged groups;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) that such conditions can be improved by providing the maximum practicable opportunity for the development of small business concerns owned by members of socially and economically disadvantaged groups;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) that such development can be materially advanced through the procurement by the United States of articles, equipment, supplies, services, materials, and construction work from such concerns; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) that such procurements also benefit the United States by encouraging the expansion of suppliers for such procurements, thereby encouraging competition among such suppliers and promoting economy in such procurements.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) It is therefore the purpose of section 637(a) of this title to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) promote the business development of small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals so that such concerns can compete on an equal basis in the American economy;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) promote the competitive viability of such concerns in the marketplace by providing such available contract, financial, technical, and mangement&#160;<sup><a href="#631_3_target" name="631_3">3</a></sup> assistance as may be necessary; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) clarify and expand the program for the procurement by the United States of articles, supplies, services, materials, and construction work from small business concerns owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Assistance to disaster victims under disaster loan program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In administering the disaster loan program authorized by section 636 of this title, to the maximum extent possible, the Administration shall provide assistance and counseling to disaster victims in filing applications, providing information relevant to loan processing, and in loan closing and prompt disbursement of loan proceeds and shall give the disaster program a high priority in allocating funds for administrative expenses.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Assistance to women owned business</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) With respect to the programs and activities authorized by this chapter, the Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) women owned business has become a major contributor to the American economy by providing goods and services, revenues, and jobs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) over the past two decades there have been substantial gains in the social and economic status of women as they have sought economic equality and independence;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) despite such progress, women, as a group, are subjected to discrimination in entrepreneurial endeavors due to their gender;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) such discrimination takes many overt and subtle forms adversely impacting the ability to raise or secure capital, to acquire managerial talents, and to capture market opportunities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) it is in the national interest to expeditiously remove discriminatory barriers to the creation and development of small business concerns owned and controlled by women;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) the removal of such barriers is essential to provide a fair opportunity for full participation in the free enterprise system by women and to further increase the economic vitality of the Nation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) increased numbers of small business concerns owned and controlled by women will directly benefit the United States Government by expanding the potential number of suppliers of goods and services to the Government; and</p>

<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 12928, Sept. 16, 1994, 59 F.R. 48377, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, in order to enforce rigorously the letter and spirit of public laws that promote increased participation in Federal procurement by Small Businesses Owned and Controlled by Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Individuals (SDBs) as described in section 8 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637), Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) as described in 34 C.F.R. 608.2, and Minority Institutions (MIs) as referred to in sections 1046(3) and 316(b)(1) of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (20 U.S.C. 1135d-5(3) and 1059c(b)(1), respectively), it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <i>Policy Statement</i>. It is the policy of the United States Government that all department and agency heads and all Federal employees involved in the procurement of any and all goods and services shall assist SDBs, HBCUs, and MIs, as applicable, to develop viable, self-sustaining businesses capable of competing on an equal basis in the mainstream of the American economy. To that end, all Federal personnel shall commit to the letter and spirit of all laws promoting the participation of SDBs, HBCUs, and MIs in Federal procurement. The laws promote:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) the award of contracts to SDBs, HBCUs, and MIs through the Small Business Administration Section 8(a) [15 U.S.C. 637(a)] Program, the Department of Defense Small and Disadvantaged Business Program, other agency programs, and through other specific statutory authority or appropriate means;</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) the establishment of particular goals for SDBs, HBCUs, or MIs on an agency-by-agency basis and the requirement that prime contractors and other recipients of Federal funds attain similar goals in their procurement; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) the establishment of other mechanisms that ensure that SDBs, HBCUs, and MIs have a fair opportunity to participate in Federal procurement.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <i>Attainment of Goals</i>. All departments and agencies are required by law to establish participation goals of not less than 5 percent (15 U.S.C. 644(g)) or a greater percentage where otherwise required by law, as further provided in the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Letter No. 91&ndash;1 of March 11, 1991. Although the Federal Government has made substantial strides toward meeting established SDB, HBCU, and MI participation goals, certain departments and agencies have from time to time failed to aggressively pursue such goals. Department and agency heads are henceforth directed to execute, implement, and otherwise aggressively strive to fulfill the statutorily-mandated procurement participation goals. In addition, all departments and agencies are encouraged to set reasonable participation goals that exceed statutory requirements, to the extent permitted by law.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <i>Subcontracting Plans</i>. The Small Business Act, (15 U.S.C. 637(d)) and other related laws require certain prime contractors to maximize the use of SDBs in subcontracting plans and strive to achieve stated goals through prime contractors&apos; subcontracting practices. Department and agency heads are directed to aggressively enforce these prime contractors&apos; obligations to maximize awards of subcontracts to eligible SDBs.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <i>Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (&quot;OSDBU&quot;).</i></p>
<p class="note-body">(a) Section 15(k) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 644(k)) establishes in each Federal department and agency an OSDBU and requires that the Director of the OSDBU &quot;be responsible only to, and report directly to, the head of such agency or to the deputy of such head&quot; (15 U.S.C. 644(k)(3)). To the extent not prohibited by law, each department and agency shall ensure that the aforementioned direct reporting requirements are henceforth vigorously enforced.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Because of the importance of the OSDBU function, each department and agency shall also, to the extent not prohibited by law, comply with the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Letter No. 79&ndash;1 of March 7, 1979, which provides implementation guidance on sec<!-- PDFPage:764 -->tion 15k [15(k)] and the organizational placement and functions of the OSDBU.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. <i>Anti-fraud Enforcement</i>. All department and agency heads shall ensure that in enforcing the laws and requirements mentioned in this order, Federal benefits or contracts intended for SDBs, HBCUs, and MIs are not awarded to entities that are not legitimate SDBs, HBCUs, and MIs. Department and agency anti-fraud enforcement, however, shall not diminish agency vigor in achieving the aforementioned participation goals, which exist to promote the development of legitimate SDBs, HBCUs, and MIs. Nothing herein is intended to change self-certification requirements.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 6. <i>Periodic Reports to the President</i>.

<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 631 <i>et seq</i>., the Workforce Investment Act, [former] 29 U.S.C. 2801 <i>et seq</i>., and the Trade Act of 1974, 19 U.S.C. 2271 <i>et seq</i>.

In addition, the United States has recently enacted a new law to facilitate trade with the countries of Sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean Basin. Federal agencies should take steps to assist small businesses, including businesses headed by underserved populations, in capitalizing on these new opportunities.

<p class="note-body">(b) For the purposes of this order, &quot;businesses headed by underserved populations&quot; means businesses headed by women or minorities, and/or located in rural communities.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <i>Expedited Response to Worker Dislocation</i>.

In addition, the Department of Labor (Labor) shall undertake a number of proactive steps to support public outreach activities aimed at workers, employers, the media, local officials, the community, and labor organizations and their members to improve awareness of the adjustment assistance available through Labor programs, including, but not limited to:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(1) developing a set of methods to inform employers of the services available through Labor workforce programs, which will explain the requirements of the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, 29 U.S.C. 2101 <i>et seq</i>., and provide information on worker adjustment programs, including the Trade Adjustment Assistance and the basic dislocated worker programs, emphasizing the importance of early intervention to minimize the affects of work layoffs;</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">(6) to the extent permitted by law, and subject to the availability of appropriations, providing funding or an outreach campaign for secondary workers (i.e., individuals indirectly affected by increased imports from other countries).</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The Secretary of Labor, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce and the United States Trade Representative, shall report annually on the employment effects of the establishment of permanent normal trade relations with the People's Republic of China.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Establishing an Interagency Task Force on Federal Contracting Opportunities for Small Businesses</h4>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum of President of the United States, Apr. 26, 2010, 75 F.R. 22499, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies</p>
<p class="note-body">The Federal Government is the world's largest purchaser of goods and services, with purchases totaling over $500 billion per year. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act) and other national investments are providing new opportunities for small businesses to compete for Federal contracts, and it is critical that these investments tap into the talents and skills of a broad cross-section of American business and industry. Small businesses must be able to participate in the Nation's economic recovery, including businesses owned by women, minorities, socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and service-disabled veterans of our Armed Forces. These businesses should be able to compete and participate effectively in Federal contracts.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Congress has established a number of statutory goals designed to help small businesses compete for Federal contracts. In addition to the goal of awarding at least 23 percent of all Federal prime contracting dollars to small businesses, the Congress also established Government-wide contracting goals for participation by small businesses that are located in Historically Underutilized Business Zones (at least 3 percent) or that are owned by women (at least 5 percent), socially and economically disadvantaged individuals (at least 5 percent), and service-disabled veterans (at least 3 percent). These aspirational goals help ensure that all Americans share in the jobs and opportunities created by Federal procurement.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:766 --><p class="note-body">In recent years, the Federal Government has not consistently reached its small business contracting goals. Although we have made some progress&mdash;particularly with respect to Recovery Act contracts&mdash;more work can and should be done. I am committed to ensuring that small businesses, including firms owned by women, minorities, socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and service-disabled veterans, have fair access to Federal Government contracting. Indeed, where small businesses have the capacity to do more, we should strive to exceed the statutory goals. While Chief Acquisition Officers and Senior Procurement Executives have many priorities, small business contracting should always be a high priority in the procurement process.</p>
<p class="note-body">Obtaining tangible results will require an honest and accurate accounting of our progress so that we can have transparency and accountability through Federal small business procurement data. Additionally, we must expand outreach strategies to alert small firms to Federal contracting opportunities.</p>
<p class="note-body">In order to coordinate executive departments&apos; and agencies&apos; efforts towards ensuring that all small businesses have a fair chance to participate in Federal contracting opportunities, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <i>Establishment</i>. There is established an Interagency Task Force on Federal Contracting Opportunities for Small Businesses (Task Force). The Secretary of Commerce (Secretary), the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (Director), and the Administrator of the Small Business Administration (Administrator) shall serve as Co-Chairs of the Task Force and shall direct its work.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <i>Membership</i>. In addition to the Secretary, the Director, and the Administrator, the Task Force shall consist of the following members:</p>
<p class="note-body">(i) the Secretary of the Treasury;</p>
<p class="note-body">(ii) the Secretary of Defense;</p>
<p class="note-body">(iii) the Attorney General;</p>
<p class="note-body">(iv) the Secretary of Labor;</p>

<p class="note-body">(viii) the Secretary of Homeland Security;</p>
<p class="note-body">(ix) the Administrator of General Services;</p>
<p class="note-body">(x) the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration;</p>
<p class="note-body">(xi) the Director of the Minority Business Development Agency;</p>
<p class="note-body">(xii) the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy;</p>
<p class="note-body">(xiii) the Director of the Domestic Policy Council;</p>
<p class="note-body">(xiv) the Director of the National Economic Council;</p>
<p class="note-body">(xv) the Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(xvi) the heads of such other executive departments, agencies, and offices as the President may, from time to time, designate.</p>
<p class="note-body">A member of the Task Force may designate, to perform the Task Force functions of the member, one or more senior officials who are part of the member's department, agency, or office, and who are full-time officers or employees of the Federal Government.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <i>Functions</i>. The Task Force shall provide to the President, not later than 120 days after the date of this memorandum, proposals and recommendations for:</p>
<p class="note-body">(i) using innovative strategies, such as teaming, to increase opportunities for small business contractors and utilizing and expanding mentorship programs, such as the mentor-prot&#233;g&#233; program;</p>
<p class="note-body">(ii) removing barriers to participation by small businesses in the Federal marketplace by unbundling large projects, improving training of Federal acquisition officials with respect to strategies for increasing small business contracting opportunities, and utilizing new technologies to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of Federal program managers, acquisition officials, and the Directors of Offices of Small Business Programs and Offices of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization, their managers, and procurement center representatives in identifying and providing access to these opportunities;</p>
<p class="note-body">(iii) expanding outreach strategies to match small businesses, including firms located in Historically Underutilized Business Zones and firms owned and controlled by women, minorities, socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and service-disabled veterans of our Armed Forces, with contracting and subcontracting opportunities; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(iv) establishing policies, including revision or clarification of existing legislation, regulations, or policies, that are necessary or appropriate to effectuate the objectives of this memorandum.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <i>Using Technology to Improve Transparency and Accountability</i>. Within 90 days of the date of this memorandum, the Assistant to the President and Chief Technology Officer and the Federal Chief Information Officer, in coordination with the Task Force, shall develop a website that illustrates the participation of small businesses, including those owned by women, minorities, socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and service-disabled veterans of our Armed Forces, in Federal contracting. To foster greater accountability and transparency in, and allow oversight of, the Federal Government's progress, this website shall be designed to encourage improved collection, verification, and availability of Federal procurement data and provide accurate data on the Federal Government's progress in ensuring that all small businesses have a fair chance to participate in Federal contracting opportunities.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. <i>Outreach</i>. In developing its recommendations, the Task Force shall conduct outreach with representatives of small businesses and small business associations.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 6. <i>General Provisions</i>. (a) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of any necessary appropriations.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) This memorandum does not create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) The heads of executive departments and agencies shall assist and provide information to the Task Force, consistent with applicable law, as may be necessary to carry out the functions of the Task Force. Each executive department and agency shall bear its own expenses of participating in the Task Force.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) The Director is hereby authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Small business concerns</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For the purposes of this chapter, a small-business concern, including but not limited to enterprises that are engaged in the business of production of food and fiber, ranching and raising of livestock, aquaculture, and all other farming and agricultural related industries, shall be deemed to be one which is independently owned and operated and which is not dominant in its field of operation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Establishment of size standards</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In addition to the criteria specified in paragraph (1) and subject to the requirements specified under subparagraph (C), the Administrator may specify detailed definitions or standards by which a business concern may be determined to be a small business concern for the purposes of this chapter or any other Act.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Additional criteria</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The standards described in paragraph (1) may utilize number of employees, dollar volume of business, net worth, net income, a combination thereof, or other appropriate factors.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Unless specifically authorized by statute, no Federal department (including the Administration when acting pursuant to subparagraph (A)) or agency may prescribe a size standard for categorizing a business concern as a small business concern, unless such proposed size standard&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) is proposed after an opportunity for public notice and comment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) provides for determining&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the size of a manufacturing concern as measured by the manufacturing concern's average employment based upon employment during each of the manufacturing concern's pay periods for the preceding 24 months;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the size of a business concern providing services on the basis of the annual average gross receipts of the business concern over a period of not less than 5 years;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) the size of other business concerns on the basis of data over a period of not less than 3 years; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(IV) other appropriate factors; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) is approved by the Administrator.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Variation by industry and consideration of other factors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">When establishing or approving any size standard pursuant to paragraph (2), the Administrator shall ensure that the size standard varies from industry to industry to the extent necessary to reflect the differing characteristics of the various industries and consider other factors deemed to be relevant by the Administrator.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Exclusion of certain security expenses from consideration for purpose of small business size standards</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Determination required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Not later than 30 days after January 6, 2006, the Administrator shall review the application of size standards established pursuant to paragraph (2) to small business concerns that are performing contracts in qualified areas and determine whether it would be fair and appropriate to exclude from consideration in the average annual gross receipts of such small business concerns any payments made to such small business concerns by Federal agencies to reimburse such small business concerns for the cost of subcontracts entered for the sole purpose of providing security services in a qualified area.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Action required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Not later than 60 days after January 6, 2006, the Administrator shall either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) initiate an adjustment to the size standards, as described in subparagraph (A), if the Administrator determines that such an adjustment would be fair and appropriate; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) provide a report to the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship of the Senate and the Committee on Small Business of the House of Representatives explaining in detail the basis for the determination by the Administrator that such an adjustment would not be fair and appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Qualified areas</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In this paragraph, the term &quot;qualified area&quot; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) Iraq,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) Afghanistan, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) any foreign country which included a combat zone, as that term is defined in section 112(c)(2) of title 26, at the time of performance of the relevant Federal contract or subcontract.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Alternative size standard</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Administrator shall establish an alternative size standard for applicants for business loans under section 636(a) of this title and applicants for development company loans under title V of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 (15 U.S.C. 695 et <!-- PDFPage:770 -->seq.), that uses maximum tangible net worth and average net income as an alternative to the use of industry standards.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Interim rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Until the date on which the alternative size standard established under subparagraph (A) is in effect, an applicant for a business loan under section 636(a) of this title or an applicant for a development company loan under title V of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 may be eligible for such a loan if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the maximum tangible net worth of the applicant is not more than $15,000,000; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the average net income after Federal income taxes (excluding any carry-over losses) of the applicant for the 2 full fiscal years before the date of the application is not more than $5,000,000.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Proposed rulemaking</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In conducting rulemaking to revise, modify or establish size standards pursuant to this section, the Administrator shall consider, and address, and make publicly available as part of the notice of proposed rulemaking and notice of final rule each of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a detailed description of the industry for which the new size standard is proposed;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) an analysis of the competitive environment for that industry;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the approach the Administrator used to develop the proposed standard including the source of all data used to develop the proposed rule making; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the anticipated effect of the proposed rulemaking on the industry, including the number of concerns not currently considered small that would be considered small under the proposed rule making and the number of concerns currently considered small that would be deemed other than small under the proposed rulemaking.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Common size standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In carrying out this subsection, the Administrator may establish or approve a single size standard for a grouping of 4-digit North American Industry Classification System codes only if the Administrator makes publicly available, not later than the date on which such size standard is established or approved, a justification demonstrating that such size standard is appropriate for each individual industry classification included in the grouping.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Number of size standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Administrator shall not limit the number of size standards established pursuant to paragraph (2), and shall assign the appropriate size standard to each North American Industry Classification System Code.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(9) Petitions for reconsideration of size standards</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A person may file a petition for reconsideration with the Office of Hearings and Appeals (as established under section 634(i) of this title) of a size standard revised, modified, or established by the Administrator pursuant to this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Time limit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A person filing a petition for reconsideration described in subparagraph (A) shall file such petition not later than 30 days after the publication in the Federal Register of the notice of final rule to revise, modify, or establish size standards described in paragraph (6).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Process for agency review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Office of Hearings and Appeals shall use the same process it uses to decide challenges to the size of a small business concern to decide a petition for review pursuant to this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Judicial review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The publication of a final rule in the Federal Register described in subparagraph (B) shall be considered final agency action for purposes of seeking judicial review. Filing a petition for reconsideration under subparagraph (A) shall not be a condition precedent to judicial review of any such size standard.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Rules or guidance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Office of Hearings and Appeals shall begin accepting petitions for reconsideration described in subparagraph (A) after the date on which the Administration issues a rule or other guidance implementing this paragraph. Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (B), petitions for reconsideration of size standards revised, modified, or established in a Federal Register final rule published between November 25, 2015, and the effective date of such rule or other guidance shall be considered timely if filed within 30 days of such effective date.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) &quot;Agency&quot; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this chapter, any reference to an agency or department of the United States, and the term &quot;Federal agency&quot;, shall have the meaning given the term &quot;agency&quot; by section 551(1) of title 5, but does not include the United States Postal Service or the Government Accountability Office.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Qualified employee trust; eligibility for loan guarantee; &quot;qualified employee trust&quot; defined; regulations for treatment of trust as qualified employee trust</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) For purposes of this chapter, a qualified employee trust shall be eligible for any loan guarantee under section 636(a) of this title with respect to a small business concern on the same basis as if such trust were the same legal entity as such concern.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of this chapter, the term &quot;qualified employee trust&quot; means, with respect to a small business concern, a trust&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) which forms part of an employee stock ownership plan (as defined in section 4975(e)(7) of title 26)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) which is maintained by such concern, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) which provides that each participant is entitled to direct the plan trustee as to the manner of how to vote the qualified em<!-- PDFPage:771 -->ployer securities (as defined in section 4975(e)(8) of title 26), which are allocated to the account of such participant with respect to a corporate matter which (by law or charter) must be decided by a vote conducted in accordance with section 409(e) of the title 26; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in the case of any loan guarantee under section 636(a) of this title, the trustee of which enters into an agreement with the Administrator which is binding on the trust and on such small business concern and which provides that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the loan guaranteed under section 636(a) of this title shall be used solely for the purchase of qualifying employer securities of such concern,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) all funds acquired by the concern in such purchase shall be used by such concern solely for the purposes for which such loan was guaranteed,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) such concern will provide such funds as may be necessary for the timely repayment of such loan, and the property of such concern shall be available as security for repayment of such loan, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) all qualifying employer securities acquired by such trust in such purchase shall be allocated to the accounts of participants in such plan who are entitled to share in such allocation, and each participant has a nonforfeitable right, not later than the date such loan is repaid, to all such qualifying employer securities which are so allocated to the participant's account.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Under regulations which may be prescribed by the Administrator, a trust may be treated as a qualified employee trust with respect to a small business concern if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the trust is maintained by an employee organization which represents at least 51 percent of the employees of such concern, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) such concern maintains a plan&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) which is an employee benefit plan which is designed to invest primarily in qualifying employer securities (as defined in section 4975(e)(8) of title 26),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) which provides that each participant in the plan is entitled to direct the plan as to the manner in which voting rights under qualifying employer securities which are allocated to the account of such participant are to be exercised with respect to a corporate matter which (by law or charter) must be decided by a majority vote of the outstanding common shares voted,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) which provides that each participant who is entitled to distribution from the plan has a right, in the case of qualifying employer securities which are not readily tradeable on an established market, to require that the concern repurchase such securities under a fair valuation formula, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) which meets such other requirements (similar to requirements applicable to employee stock ownership plans as defined in section 4975(e)(7) of title 26) as the Administrator may prescribe, and</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Seal; appointment and compensation of personnel; use of other services and facilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administration shall have power to adopt, alter, and use a seal, which shall be judicially noticed. The Administrator is authorized, subject to the civil service and classification laws, to select, employ, appoint, and fix the compensation of such officers, employees, attorneys, and agents as shall be necessary to carry out the provisions of this chapter; to define their authority and duties; and to pay the costs of qualification of certain of them as notaries public. The Administration, with the consent of any board, commission, independent establishment, or executive department of the Government, may avail itself on a reimbursable or nonreimbursable basis of the use of information, services, facilities (including any field service thereof), officers, and employees thereof, in carrying out the provisions of this chapter.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:792 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Powers of Administrator</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the performance of, and with respect to, the functions, powers, and duties vested in him by this chapter the Administrator may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) sue and be sued in any court of record of a State having general jurisdiction, or in any United States district court, and jurisdiction is conferred upon such district court to determine such controversies without regard to the amount in controversy; but no attachment, injunction, garnishment, or other similar process, mesne or final, shall be issued against the Administrator or his property;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) under regulations prescribed by him, assign or sell at public or private sale, or otherwise dispose of for cash or credit, in his discretion and upon such terms and conditions and for such consideration as the Administrator shall determine to be reasonable, any evidence of debt, contract, claim, personal property, or security assigned to or held by him in connection with the payment of loans granted under this chapter, and to collect or compromise all obligations assigned to or held by him and all legal or equitable rights accruing to him in connection with the payment of such loans until such time as such obligations may be referred to the Attorney General for suit or collection;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) deal with, complete, renovate, improve, modernize, insure, or rent, or sell for cash or credit upon such terms and conditions and for such consideration as the Administrator shall determine to be reasonable, any real property conveyed to or otherwise acquired by him in connection with the payment of loans granted under this chapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) pursue to final collection, by way of compromise or otherwise, all claims against third parties assigned to the Administrator in connection with loans made by him. This shall include authority to obtain deficiency judgments or otherwise in the case of mortgages assigned to the Administrator. Section 6101 of title 41 shall not be construed to apply to any contract of hazard insurance or to any purchase or contract for services or supplies on account of property obtained by the Administrator as a result of loans made under this chapter if the premium therefor or the amount thereof does not exceed $1,000. The power to convey and to execute in the name of the Administrator deeds of conveyance, deeds of release, assignments and satisfactions of mortgages, and any other written instrument relating to real property or any interest therein acquired by the Administrator pursuant to the provisions of this chapter may be exercised by the Administrator or by any officer or agent appointed by him without the execution of any express delegation of power or power of attorney. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the Administrator from delegating such power by order or by power of attorney, in his discretion, to any officer or agent he may appoint;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) acquire, in any lawful manner, any property (real, personal, or mixed, tangible or intangible), whenever deemed necessary or appropriate to the conduct of the activities authorized in sections 636(a) and 636(b) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) make such rules and regulations as he deems necessary to carry out the authority vested in him by or pursuant to this chapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) in addition to any powers, functions, privileges and immunities otherwise vested in him, take any and all actions (including the procurement of the services of attorneys by contract in any office where an attorney or attorneys are not or cannot be economically employed full time to render such services) when he determines such actions are necessary or desirable in making, servicing, compromising, modifying, liquidating, or otherwise dealing with or realizing on loans made under the provisions of this chapter: <i>Provided</i>, That with respect to deferred participation loans, including loans guaranteed under paragraph (15) or (35) of section 636(a) of this title, the Administrator may, in the discretion of and pursuant to regulations promulgated by the Administrator, authorize participating lending institutions to take actions relating to loan servicing on behalf of the Administrator, including determining eligibility and creditworthiness and loan monitoring, collection, and liquidation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) pay the transportation expenses and per diem in lieu of subsistence expenses, in accordance with subchapter I of chapter 57 of title 5, for travel of any person employed by the Administration to render temporary services not in excess of six months in connection with any disaster referred to in section 636(b) of this title from place of appointment to, and while at, the disaster area and any other temporary posts of duty and return upon completion of the assignment: <i>Provided</i>, That the Administrator may extend the six-month limitation for an additional six months if the Administrator determines the extension is necessary to continue efficient disaster loan making activities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) accept the services and facilities of Federal, State, and local agencies and groups, both public and private, and utilize such gratuitous services and facilities as may, from time to time, be necessary, to further the objectives of section 636(b) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) upon purchase by the Administration of any deferred participation entered into under section 636 of this title, continue to charge a rate of interest not to exceed that initially charged by the participating institution on the amount so purchased for the remaining term of the indebtedness;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) make such investigations as he deems necessary to determine whether a recipient of or participant in any assistance under this chapter or any other person has engaged or is about to engage in any acts or practices which constitute or will constitute a violation of any provision of this chapter, or of any rule or regulation under this chapter, or of any order issued under this chapter. The Administration shall permit any person to file with it a statement in writing, under oath or otherwise as the Administration shall determine, as to all the facts and circumstances concerning the matter to be investigated. For the purpose of any investigation, the Administration is empowered to administer oaths and affirmations, subpena witnesses, compel their attendance, <!-- PDFPage:793 -->take evidence, and require the production of any books, papers, and documents which are relevant to the inquiry. Such attendance of witnesses and the production of any such records may be required from any place in the United States. In case of contumacy by, or refusal to obey a subpena issued to, any person, including a recipient or participant, the Administration may invoke the aid of any court of the United States within the jurisdiction of which such investigation or proceeding is carried on, or where such person resides or carries on business, in requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of books, papers, and documents; and such court may issue an order requiring such person to appear before the Administration, there to produce records, if so ordered, or to give testimony touching the matter under investigation. Any failure to obey such order of the court may be punished by such court as a contempt thereof. All process in any such case may be served in the judicial district whereof such person is an inhabitant or wherever he may be found;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) impose, retain, and use only those fees which are specifically authorized by law or which are in effect on September 30, 1994, and in the amounts and at the rates in effect on such date, except that the Administrator may, subject to approval in appropriations Acts, impose, retain, and utilize, additional fees&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) not to exceed 1 percent of the amount of requested financings under title III of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 [15 U.S.C. 681 et seq.] for which the applicant requests a commitment from the Administration for funding during the following year; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) to recover the direct, incremental cost involved in the production and dissemination of compilations of information produced by the Administration under the authority of this chapter and the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 [15 U.S.C. 661 et seq.];</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(13) collect, retain and utilize, subject to approval in appropriations Acts, any amounts collected by fiscal transfer agents and not used by such agent as payment of the cost of loan pooling or debenture servicing operations, except that amounts collected under this paragraph and paragraph (12) shall be utilized solely to facilitate the administration of the program that generated the excess amounts; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(14) require any lender authorized to make loans under section 636 of this title to pay examination and review fees, which shall be deposited in the account for salaries and expenses of the Administration, and shall be available for the costs of examinations, reviews, and other lender oversight activities.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Procurement of experts and consultants; compensation and expenses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To such extent as he finds necessary to carry out the provisions of this chapter, the Administrator is authorized to procure the temporary (not in excess of one year) or intermittent services of experts or consultants or organizations thereof, including stenographic reporting services, by contract or appointment, and in such cases such services shall be without regard to the civil-service and classification laws and, except in the case of stenographic reporting services by organizations, without regard to section 6101 of title 41. Any individual so employed may be compensated at a rate not in excess of the daily equivalent of the highest rate payable under section 5332 of title 5, including travel time, and, while such individual is away from his or her home or regular place of business, he or she may be allowed travel expenses (including per diem in lieu of subsistence) as authorized by section 5703 of title 5.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Safety deposit box rentals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Section 3324(a) and (b) of title 31 shall not apply to prepayments of rentals made by the Administration on safety deposit boxes used by the Administration for the safeguarding of instruments held as security for loans or for the safeguarding of other documents.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Undertaking or suspension of payment obligation; period; extension of maturity; repayment agreement; &quot;required payments&quot; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Subject to the requirements and conditions contained in this subsection, upon application by a small business concern which is the recipient of a loan made under this chapter, the Administration may undertake the small business concern's obligation to make the required payments under such loan or may suspend such obligation if the loan was a direct loan made by the Administration. While such payments are being made by the Administration pursuant to the undertaking of such obligation or while such obligation is suspended, no such payment with respect to the loan may be required from the small business concern.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Administration may undertake or suspend for a period of not to exceed 5 years any small business concern's obligation under this subsection only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) without such undertaking or suspension of the obligation, the small business concern would, in the sole discretion of the Administration, become insolvent or remain insolvent;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) with the undertaking or suspension of the obligation, the small business concern would, in the sole discretion of the Administration, become or remain a viable small business entity; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 636(a)(4)(C) and 636(i)(1) of this title, the Administration may extend the maturity of any loan on which the Administration undertakes or suspends the obligation pursuant to this subsection for a corresponding period of time.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:794 --><p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) Prior to the undertaking or suspension by the Administration of any small business concern's obligation under this subsection, the Administration, consistent with the purposes sought to be achieved herein, shall require the small business concern to agree in writing to repay to it the aggregate amount of the payments which were required under the loan during the period for which such obligation was undertaken or suspended, either&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) prior to the Administration's approval of the sale, or upon any subsequent resale, of any loan guaranteed by the Administration, if the lender certifies that such loan has been properly closed and that the lender has substantially complied with the provisions of the guarantee agreement and the regulations of the Administration, the Administration shall review and approve only materials not previously approved;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) all fees due the Administration on a guaranteed loan shall have been paid in full prior to any sale; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) each loan, except each loan made under section 636(a)(14) of this title, shall have been fully disbursed to the borrower prior to any sale.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) After a loan is sold in the secondary market, the lender shall remain obligated under its guarantee agreement with the Administration, and shall continue to service the loan in a manner consistent with the terms and conditions of such agreement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Administration shall develop such procedures as are necessary for the facilitation, administration, and promotion of secondary market operations, and for assessing the increase of small business access to capital at reasonable rates and terms as a result of secondary market operations. Beginning on March 31, 1997, the sale of the unguaranteed portion of any loan made under section 636(a) of this title shall not be permitted until a final regulation that applies uniformly to both depository institutions and other lenders is promulgated by the Administration setting forth the terms and conditions under which such sales can be permitted, including maintenance of appropriate reserve requirements and other safeguards to protect the safety and soundness of the program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Nothing in this subsection or subsection (g) of this section shall be interpreted to impede or extinguish the right of the borrower or the successor in interest to such borrower to prepay (in whole or in part) any loan made pursuant to section 636(a) of this title, the guaranteed portion of which may be included in such trust or pool, or to impede or extinguish the rights of any party pursuant to section 636(a)(6)(C) of this title or subsection (e) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Trust certificates; guarantee of timely payments of principal and interest; full faith and credit of United States; collection of fees; subrogation; division of loan guarantees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Administration is authorized to issue trust certificates representing ownership of all or a fractional part of the guaranteed portion of one or more loans which have been guaranteed by the Administration under this chapter, or under section 696 of this title: <i>Provided</i>, That such trust certificates shall be based on and backed by a trust or pool approved by the Administration and composed solely of the entire guaranteed portion of such loans.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Administration is authorized, upon such terms and conditions as are deemed appropriate, to guarantee the timely payment of the principal of and interest on trust certificates issued by the Administration or its agent for purposes of this subsection. Such guarantee shall be limited to the extent of principal and interest on the guaranteed portions of loans which compose the trust or pool. In the event that a loan in such trust or pool is prepaid, either voluntarily or in the event of default, the guarantee of timely payment of principal and interest on the trust certificates shall be reduced in proportion to the amount of principal and interest such prepaid loan represents in the trust or pool. Interest on prepaid or defaulted loans shall accrue and be guaranteed by the Administration only through the date of payment on the guarantee. During the term of the trust certificate, it may be called for redemption due to prepayment or default of all loans constituting the pool.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The full faith and credit of the United States is pledged to the payment of all amounts which may be required to be paid under any guarantee of such trust certificates issued by the Administration or its agent pursuant to this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) The Administration may collect a fee for any loan guarantee sold into the secondary market under subsection (f) in an amount equal <!-- PDFPage:795 -->to not more than 50 percent of the portion of the sale price that exceeds 110 percent of the outstanding principal amount of the portion of the loan guaranteed by the Administration. Any such fee imposed by the Administration shall be collected by the Administration or by the agent which carries out on behalf of the Administration the central registration functions required by subsection (h) of this section and shall be paid to the Administration and used solely to reduce the subsidy on loans guaranteed under section 636(a) of this title: <i>Provided</i>, That such fee shall not be charged to the borrower whose loan is guaranteed: and, <i>Provided further</i>, That nothing herein shall preclude any agent of the Administration from collecting a fee approved by the Administration for the functions described in subsection (h)(2).<sup><a href="#634_1_target" name="634_1">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Administration is authorized to impose and collect, either directly or through a fiscal and transfer agent, a reasonable penalty on late payments of the fee authorized under subparagraph (A) in an amount not to exceed 5 percent of such fee per month plus interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Administration may contract with an agent to carry out, on behalf of the Administration, the assessment and collection of the annual fee established under section 636(a)(23) of this title. The agent may receive, as compensation for services, any interest earned on the fee while in the control of the agent before the time at which the agent is contractually required to remit the fee to the Administration.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) In the event the Administration pays a claim under a guarantee issued under this subsection, it shall be subrogated fully to the rights satisfied by such payment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) No State or local law, and no Federal law, shall preclude or limit the exercise by the Administration of its ownership rights in the portions of loans constituting the trust or pool against which the trust certificates are issued.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) If the amount of the guaranteed portion of any loan under section 636(a) of this title is more than $500,000, the Administrator shall, upon request of a pool assembler, divide the loan guarantee into increments of $500,000 and 1 increment of any remaining amount less than $500,000, in order to permit the maximum amount of any loan in a pool to be not more than $500,000. Only 1 increment of any loan guarantee divided under this paragraph may be included in the same pool. Increments of loan guarantees to different borrowers that are divided under this paragraph may be included in the same pool.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Central registration of loans and trust certificates; contracts with agent; disclosures by sellers of guaranteed portions of loans; regulation of brokers and dealers; electronic registration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Upon the adoption of final rules and regulations, the Administration shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) provide for a central registration of all loans and trust certificates sold pursuant to subsections (f) and (g) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) contract with an agent to carry out on behalf of the Administration the central registration functions of this section and the issuance of trust certificates to facilitate pooling. Such agent shall provide a fidelity bond or insurance in such amounts as the Administration determines to be necessary to fully protect the interest of the Government;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) prior to any sale, require the seller to disclose to a purchaser of the guaranteed portion of a loan guaranteed under this chapter and to the purchaser of a trust certificate issued pursuant to subsection (g), information on the terms, conditions, and yield of such instrument. As used in this paragraph, if the instrument being sold is a loan, the term &quot;seller&quot; does not include (A) an entity which made the loan or (B) any individual or entity which sells three or fewer guaranteed loans per year; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) have the authority to regulate brokers and dealers in guaranteed loans and trust certificates sold pursuant to subsections (f) and (g) of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The agent described in paragraph (1)(B) may be compensated through any of the fees assessed under this section and any interest earned on any funds collected by the agent while such funds are in the control of the agent and before the time at which the agent is contractually required to transfer such funds to the Administration or to the holders of the trust certificates, as appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Nothing in this subsection shall prohibit the utilization of a book-entry or other electronic form of registration for trust certificates.

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Loans to small business concerns; allowable purposes; qualified business; restrictions and limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administration is empowered to the extent and in such amounts as provided in advance in appropriation Acts to make loans for plant acquisition, construction, conversion, or expansion, including the acquisition of land, material, supplies, equipment, and working capital, and to make loans to any qualified small business concern, including those owned by qualified Indian tribes, for purposes of this chapter. Such financings may be made either directly or in cooperation with banks or other financial institutions through agreements to participate on an immediate or deferred (guaranteed) basis. These powers shall be subject, however, to the following restrictions, limitations, and provisions:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>Credit elsewhere</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator has the authority to direct, and conduct oversight for, the methods by which lenders determine whether a borrower is able to obtain credit elsewhere. No financial assistance shall be extended pursuant to this subsection if the applicant can obtain credit elsewhere. No immediate participation may be purchased unless it is shown that a deferred participation is not available; and no direct financing may be made unless it is shown that a participation is not available.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) <cap-smallcap>Liquidity</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;On and after October 1, 2015, the Administrator may not guarantee a loan under this subsection if the lender determines that the borrower is unable to obtain credit elsewhere solely because the liquidity of the lender depends upon the guaranteed portion of the loan being sold on the secondary market.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Background checks</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Prior to the approval of any loan made pursuant to this subsection, or section 503 of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 [15 U.S.C. 697], the Administrator may verify the applicant's criminal background, or lack thereof, through the best available means, including, if possible, use of the National Crime Information Center computer system at the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) <cap-smallcap>Lending limits of lenders</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;On and after October 1, 2015, the Administrator may not guarantee a loan under this subsection if the sole purpose for requesting the guarantee is to allow the lender to exceed the legal lending limit of the lender.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Level of participation in guaranteed loans.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except as provided in subparagraphs (B), (D), (E), and (F), in an agreement to participate in a loan on a deferred basis under this subsection (including a loan made under the Preferred Lenders Program), such participation by the Administration shall be equal to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) 75 percent of the balance of the financing outstanding at the time of disbursement of the loan, if such balance exceeds $150,000; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) 85 percent of the balance of the financing outstanding at the time of disbursement of the loan, if such balance is less than or equal to $150,000.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Reduced participation upon request.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The guarantee percentage specified by subparagraph (A) for any loan under this subsection may be reduced upon the request of the participating lender.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) <cap-smallcap>Prohibition</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administration shall not use the guarantee percentage re<!-- PDFPage:804 -->quested by a participating lender under clause (i) as a criterion for establishing priorities in approving loan guarantee requests under this subsection.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) <cap-smallcap>Interest rate under preferred lenders program.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The maximum interest rate for a loan guaranteed under the Preferred Lenders Program shall not exceed the maximum interest rate, as determined by the Administration, applicable to other loans guaranteed under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) <cap-smallcap>Export-import bank lenders</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Any lender that is participating in the Delegated Authority Lender Program of the Export-Import Bank of the United States (or any successor to the Program) shall be eligible to participate in the Preferred Lenders Program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) <cap-smallcap>Preferred lenders program defined</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For purposes of this subparagraph, the term &quot;Preferred Lenders Program&quot; means any program established by the Administrator, as authorized under the proviso in section 634(b)(7) of this title, under which a written agreement between the lender and the Administration delegates to the lender&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) complete authority to make and close loans with a guarantee from the Administration without obtaining the prior specific approval of the Administration; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) complete authority to service and liquidate such loans without obtaining the prior specific approval of the Administration for routine servicing and liquidation activities, but shall not take any actions creating an actual or apparent conflict of interest.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) <cap-smallcap>Participation in international trade loan</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In an agreement to participate in a loan on a deferred basis under paragraph (16), the participation by the Administration may not exceed 90 percent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) <cap-smallcap>Participation in the paycheck protection program</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In an agreement to participate in a loan on a deferred basis under paragraph (36), the participation by the Administration shall be 100 percent.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) No loan shall be made under this subsection&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) if the total amount outstanding and committed (by participation or otherwise) to the borrower from the business loan and investment fund established by this chapter would exceed $3,750,000 (or if the gross loan amount would exceed $5,000,000), except as provided in subparagraph (B);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if the total amount outstanding and committed (on a deferred basis) solely for the purposes provided in paragraph (16) to the borrower from the business loan and investment fund established by this chapter would exceed $4,500,000 (or if the gross loan amount would exceed $5,000,000), of which not more than $4,000,000 may be used for working capital, supplies, or financings under paragraph (14) for export purposes; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) if effected either directly or in cooperation with banks or other lending institutions through agreements to participate on an immediate basis if the amount would exceed $350,000.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Interest rates and prepayment charges.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>Interest rates</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding the provisions of the constitution of any State or the laws of any State limiting the rate or amount of interest which may be charged, taken, received, or reserved, the maximum legal rate of interest on any financing made on a deferred basis pursuant to this subsection shall not exceed a rate prescribed by the Administration, and the rate of interest for the Administration's share of any direct or immediate participation loan shall not exceed the current average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with remaining periods to maturity comparable to the average maturities of such loans and adjusted to the nearest one-eighth of 1 per centum, and an additional amount as determined by the Administration, but not to exceed 1 per centum per annum: <i>Provided</i>, That for those loans to assist any public or private organization for the handicapped or to assist any handicapped individual as provided in paragraph (10) of this subsection, the interest rate shall be 3 per centum per annum.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Payment of accrued interest.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Any bank or other lending institution making a claim for payment on the guaranteed portion of a loan made under this subsection shall be paid the accrued interest due on the loan from the earliest date of default to the date of payment of the claim at a rate not to exceed the rate of interest on the loan on the date of default, minus one percent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) <cap-smallcap>Loans sold on secondary market</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If a loan described in clause (i) is sold on the secondary market, the amount of interest paid to a bank or other lending institution described in that clause from the earliest date of default to the date of payment of the claim shall be no more than the agreed upon rate, minus one percent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) <cap-smallcap>Applicability</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Clauses (i) and (ii) shall not apply to loans made on or after October 1, 2000.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(1) the Capital Ownership Development Program administered by the Small Business Administration and the award of contracts pursuant to section 8(a) of the Small Business Act [15 U.S.C. 637(a)] remain a primary tool for improving opportunities for small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals in the Federal procurement process and bringing such concerns into the nation's economic mainstream;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(2) although some progress has resulted from the Program, it has generally failed to meet its objectives, which remain as valid now as when the Program was initiated;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(3) too few concerns that have exited the Program have been prepared to compete successfully in the open marketplace on competitive procurements, and many concerns have developed an unhealthy dependency on sole-source contracts by the time they are required to leave the Program;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(4) the application and certification process for admitting new participants to the Program is inordinately lengthy and burdensome;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(5) the Administration has often not efficiently and equitably administered and managed the Program in a manner that provided clear lines of responsibility for implementing and monitoring many of the administrative duties under the Program;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(6) the Administration and some program participants have given insufficient attention and support to the business development goals of the Program and instead have focused almost entirely on the size of contract awards or the number of firms certified to participate in the Program;</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(9) the widespread perception of undue political influence in the operation and administration of the Program has significantly contributed to the Program's poor image and has deterred utilization of the <!-- PDFPage:875 -->Program by socially and economically disadvantaged concerns and by Federal procuring agencies; and</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(2) affirm that the measure of success of the Capital Ownership Development Program, and the section 8(a) authority, shall be the number of competitive firms that exit the Program without being unreasonably reliant on section 8(a) contracts and that are able to compete on an equal basis in the mainstream of the American economy;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(3) ensure that program benefits accrue to individuals who are both socially and economically disadvantaged;</p>

<p class="note-body">&quot;(5) The Administration shall establish personnel positions for Business Opportunity Specialists employed in the regions designated pursuant to paragraph (1) that are classified at a grade level of the General Schedule that are sufficient, in the opinion of the Administrator, to attract and retain highly qualified personnel.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) It shall be the duty of the Administration and it is hereby empowered, whenever it determines such action is necessary or appropriate&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) to enter into contracts with the United States Government and any department, agency, or officer thereof having procurement powers obligating the Administration to furnish articles, equipment, supplies, services, or materials to the Government or to perform construction work for the Government. In any case in which the Administration certifies to any officer of the Government having procurement powers that the Administration is competent and responsible to perform any specific Government procurement contract to be let by any such officer, such officer shall be authorized in his discretion to let such procurement contract to the Administration upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed upon between the Administration and the procurement officer. Whenever the Administration and such procurement officer fail to agree, the matter shall be submitted for determination to the Secretary or the head of the appropriate department or agency by the Administrator. Not later than 5 days from the date the Administration is notified of a procurement officer's adverse decision, the Administration may notify the contracting officer of the intent to appeal such adverse decision, and within 15 days of such date the Administrator shall file a written request for a reconsideration of the adverse decision with the Secretary of the department or agency head. For the purposes of this subparagraph, a procurement officer's adverse decision includes a decision not to make available for award pursuant to this subsection a particular procurement requirement or the failure to agree on the terms and conditions of a contract to be awarded noncompetitively under the authority of this subsection. Upon receipt of the notice of intent to appeal, the Secretary of the department or the agency head shall suspend further action regarding the procurement until a written decision on the Administrator's request for reconsideration has been issued by such Secretary or agency head, unless such officer makes a written determination that urgent and compelling circumstances which significantly affect interests of the United States will not permit waiting for a reconsideration of the adverse decision. If the Administrator's request for reconsideration is denied, the Secretary of the de<!-- PDFPage:891 -->partment or agency head shall specify the reasons why the selected firm was determined to be incapable to perform the procurement requirement, and the findings supporting such determination, which shall be made a part of the contract file for the requirement. A contract may not be awarded under this subsection if the award of the contract would result in a cost to the awarding agency which exceeds a fair market price;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) to arrange for the performance of such procurement contracts by negotiating or otherwise letting subcontracts to socially and economically disadvantaged small business concerns for construction work, services, or the manufacture, supply, assembly of such articles, equipment, supplies, materials, or parts thereof, or servicing or processing in connection therewith, or such management services as may be necessary to enable the Administration to perform such contracts;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) to make an award to a small business concern owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals which has completed its period of Program Participation as prescribed by section 636(j)(15) of this title, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the contract will be awarded as a result of an offer (including price) submitted in response to a published solicitation relating to a competition conducted pursuant to subparagraph (D); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the prospective contract awardee was a Program Participant eligible for award of the contract on the date specified for receipt of offers contained in the contract solicitation; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D)(i) A contract opportunity offered for award pursuant to this subsection shall be awarded on the basis of competition restricted to eligible Program Participants if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) there is a reasonable expectation that at least two eligible Program Participants will submit offers and that award can be made at a fair market price, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) the anticipated award price of the contract (including options) will exceed $7,000,000 in the case of a contract opportunity assigned a standard industrial classification code for manufacturing and $3,000,000 (including options) in the case of all other contract opportunities.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) The Associate Administrator for Minority Small Business and Capital Ownership Development, on a nondelegable basis, is authorized to approve a request from an agency to award a contract opportunity under this subsection on the basis of a competition restricted to eligible Program Participants even if the anticipated award price is not expected to exceed the dollar amounts specified in clause (i)(II). Such approvals shall be granted only on a limited basis.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding subsections (a), (b), and (e) of section 3131 of title 40, no small business concern shall be required to provide any amount of any bond as a condition of receiving any subcontract under this subsection if the Administrator determines that such amount is inappropriate for such concern in performing such contract: <i>Provided</i>, That the Administrator shall exercise the authority granted by the paragraph only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the Administration takes such measures as it deems appropriate for the protection of persons furnishing materials and labor to a small business receiving any benefit pursuant to this paragraph;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the Administration assists, insofar as practicable, a small business receiving the benefits of this paragraph to develop, within a reasonable period of time, such financial and other capability as may be needed to obtain such bonds as the Administration may subsequently require for the successful completion of any program conducted under the authority of this subsection;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the Administration finds that such small business is unable to obtain the requisite bond or bonds from a surety and that no surety is willing to issue bond or bonds subject to the guarantee provisions of Title IV of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 [15 U.S.C. 692 et seq.]; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the small business is determined to be a start-up concern and such concern has not been participating in any program conducted under the authority of this subsection for a period exceeding one year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) For purposes of paragraph (1) a &quot;fair market price&quot; shall be determined by the agency offering the procurement requirement to the Administration, in accordance with clauses (ii) and (iii).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) The estimate of a current fair market price for a new procurement requirement, or a requirement that does not have a satisfactory procurement history, shall be derived from a price or cost analysis. Such analysis may take into account prevailing market conditions, commercial prices for similar products or services, or data obtained from any other agency. Such analysis shall consider such cost or pricing data as may be timely submitted by the Administration.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) The estimate of a current fair market price for a procurement requirement that has a satisfactory procurement history shall be based on recent award prices adjusted to insure comparability. Such adjustments shall take into account differences in quantities, performance times, plans, specifications, transportation costs, packaging and packing costs, labor and materials costs, overhead costs, and any other additional costs which may be deemed appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) An agency offering a procurement requirement for potential award pursuant to this subsection shall, upon the request of the Administration, promptly submit to the Administration a written statement detailing the method used by the agency to estimate the current fair mar<!-- PDFPage:892 -->ket price for such contract, identifying the information, studies, analyses, and other data used by such agency. The agency's estimate of the current fair market price (and any supporting data furnished to the Administration) shall not be disclosed to any potential offeror (other than the Administration).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) A small business concern selected by the Administration to perform or negotiate a contract to be let pursuant to this subsection may request the Administration to protest the agency's estimate of the fair market price for such contract pursuant to paragraph (1)(A).</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Declaration of policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Research and development are major factors in the growth and progress of industry and the national economy. The expense of carrying on research and development programs is beyond the means of many small-business concerns, and such concerns are handicapped in obtaining the benefits of research and development programs conducted at Government expense. These small-business concerns are thereby placed at a competitive disadvantage. This weakens the competitive free enterprise system and prevents the orderly development of the national economy. It is the policy of the Congress that assistance be given to small-business concerns to enable them to undertake and to obtain the benefits of research and development in order to maintain and strengthen the competitive free enterprise system and the national economy.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Assistance to small-business concerns</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">It is the sense of the Congress that the regular business loan program of the Small Business Administration should be reviewed by the Congress at least once every two years. It is further the sense of the Congress that the Small Business Administration should submit its estimated needs for additional authorization for such program to the Congress at least one year in advance of the date on which such authorization is to be provided, in order to assure an orderly and recurring review of such program and to avoid emergency appeals for additional authorization. Compliance by the Small Business Administration with the foregoing policy will enable the Congress on and after July 25, 1962, to provide additional authorization for such program on a two-year basis.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Small business procurements</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this chapter, small business concerns shall receive any award or contract if such award or contract is, in the determination of the Administrator and the contracting agency, in the interest of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) maintaining or mobilizing the full productive capacity of the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) war or national defense programs; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) assuring that a fair proportion of the total purchases and contracts for goods and services of the Government in each industry category (as defined under paragraph (2)) are awarded to small business concerns.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Industry category defined</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In this subsection, the term &quot;industry category&quot; means a discrete group of similar goods and services, as determined by the Administrator in accordance with the North American Industry Classification System codes used to establish small business size standards, except that the Administrator shall limit an industry category to a greater extent than provided under the North American Industry Classification System codes if the Administrator receives evidence indicating that further segmentation of the industry category is warranted&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) due to special capital equipment needs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) due to special labor requirements;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) due to special geographic requirements, except as provided in subparagraph (B);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) due to unique Federal buying patterns or requirements; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) to recognize a new industry.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Exception for geographic requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Administrator may not further segment an industry category based on geographic requirements unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the Government typically designates the geographic area where work for contracts for goods or services is to be performed;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) Government purchases comprise the major portion of the entire domestic market for such goods or services; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) it is unreasonable to expect competition from business concerns located outside of the general geographic area due to the fixed location of facilities, high mobilization costs, or similar economic factors.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Determinations with respect to awards or contracts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Determinations made pursuant to paragraph (1) may be made for individual awards or contracts, any part of an award or contract or task order, or for classes of awards or contracts or task orders.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Increasing prime contracting opportunities for small business concerns</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Description of covered proposed procurements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The requirements of this paragraph shall apply to a proposed procurement that includes in its statement of work goods or services currently being supplied or performed by a small business concern and, as determined by the Administrator&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) is in a quantity or of an estimated dollar value which makes the participation of a small business concern as a prime contractor unlikely;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) in the case of a proposed procurement for construction, seeks to bundle or consolidate discrete construction projects; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) is a solicitation that involves an unnecessary or unjustified bundling of contract requirements.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Notice to procurement center representatives</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">With respect to proposed procurements described in subparagraph (A), at least 30 days before issuing a solicitation and concurrent with other processing steps required before issuing the solicitation, the contracting agency shall provide a copy of the proposed procurement to the procurement center representative of the contracting agency (as described in subsection (l)) along with a statement explaining&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) why the proposed procurement cannot be divided into reasonably small lots (not less than economic production runs) to permit offers on quantities less than the total requirement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) why delivery schedules cannot be established on a realistic basis that will encourage the participation of small business <!-- PDFPage:974 -->concerns in a manner consistent with the actual requirements of the Government;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) why the proposed procurement cannot be offered to increase the likelihood of the participation of small business concerns;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) in the case of a proposed procurement for construction, why the proposed procurement cannot be offered as separate discrete projects; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) why the contracting agency has determined that the bundling of contract requirements is necessary and justified.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Alternatives to increase prime contracting opportunities for small business concerns</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the procurement center representative believes that the proposed procurement will make the participation of small business concerns as prime contractors unlikely, the procurement center representative, within 15 days after receiving the statement described in subparagraph (B), shall recommend to the contracting agency alternative procurement methods for increasing prime contracting opportunities for small business concerns.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Failure to agree on an alternative procurement method</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the procurement center representative and the contracting agency fail to agree on an alternative procurement method, the Administrator shall submit the matter to the head of the appropriate department or agency for a determination.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Contracts for sale of government property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">With respect to a contract for the sale of Government property, small business concerns shall receive any such contract if, in the determination of the Administrator and the disposal agency, the award of such contract is in the interest of assuring that a fair proportion of the total sales of Government property be made to small business concerns.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Sale of electrical power or other property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to change any preferences or priorities established by law with respect to the sale of electrical power or other property by the Federal Government.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Costs exceeding fair market price</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A contract may not be awarded under this subsection if the cost of the contract to the awarding agency exceeds a fair market price.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Placement of contracts by contracting procurement agency</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">With respect to any work to be performed the amount of which would exceed the maximum amount of any contract for which a surety may be guaranteed against loss under section 694b of this title, the contracting procurement agency shall, to the extent practicable, place contracts so as to allow more than one small business concern to perform such work.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Programs for blind and handicapped individuals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) As used in this subsection:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The term &quot;Committee&quot; means the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled established under section 8502 of title 41.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The term &quot;public or private organization for the handicapped&quot; has the same meaning given such term in section 632(e) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The term &quot;handicapped individual&quot; has the same meaning given such term in section 632(f) of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) During fiscal year 1995, public or private organizations for the handicapped shall be eligible to participate in programs authorized under this section in an aggregate amount not to exceed $40,000,000.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) None of the amounts authorized for participation by subparagraph (A) may be placed on the procurement list maintained by the Committee pursuant to section 8503 of title 41.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Administrator shall monitor and evaluate such participation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) Not later than ten days after the announcement of a proposed award of a contract by an agency or department to a public or private organization for the handicapped, a for-profit small business concern that has experienced or is likely to experience severe economic injury as the result of the proposed award may file an appeal of the proposed award with the Administrator.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If such a concern files an appeal of a proposed award under subparagraph (A) and the Administrator, after consultation with the Executive Director of the Committee, finds that the concern has experienced or is likely to experience severe economic injury as the result of the proposed award, not later than thirty days after the filing of the appeal, the Administration shall require each agency and department having procurement powers to take such action as may be appropriate to alleviate economic injury sustained or likely to be sustained by the concern.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Each agency and department having procurement powers shall report to the Office of Federal Procurement Policy each time a contract subject to paragraph (2)(A) is entered into, and shall include in its report the amount of the next higher bid submitted by a for-profit small business concern. The Office of Federal Procurement Policy shall collect data reported under the preceding sentence through the Federal procurement data system and shall report to the Administration which shall notify all such agencies and departments when the maximum amount of awards authorized under paragraph (2)(A) has been made during any fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) For the purpose of this subsection, a contract may be awarded only if at least 75 per centum of the direct labor performed on each item being produced under the contract in the sheltered workshop or performed in providing each type of service under the contract by the sheltered workshop is performed by handicapped individuals.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) Agencies awarding one or more contracts to such an organization pursuant to the provisions of this subsection may use multiyear contracts, if appropriate.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:975 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Priority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section priority shall be given to the awarding of contracts and the placement of subcontracts to small business concerns which shall perform a substantial proportion of the production on those contracts and subcontracts within areas of concentrated unemployment or underemployment or within labor surplus areas. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, total labor surplus area set-asides pursuant to Defense Manpower Policy Number 4 (32A C.F.R. Chapter 1) or any successor policy shall be authorized if the Secretary or his designee specifically determines that there is a reasonable expectation that offers will be obtained from a sufficient number of eligible concerns so that awards will be made at reasonable prices. As soon as practicable and to the extent possible, in determining labor surplus areas, consideration shall be given to those persons who would be available for employment were suitable employment available. Until such definition reflects such number, the present criteria of such policy shall govern.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Procurement strategies; contract bundling</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">To the maximum extent practicable, procurement strategies used by a Federal department or agency having contracting authority shall facilitate the maximum participation of small business concerns as prime contractors, subcontractors, and suppliers, and each such Federal department or agency shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) provide opportunities for the participation of small business concerns during acquisition planning processes and in acquisition plans; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) invite the participation of the appropriate Director of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization in acquisition planning processes and provide that Director access to acquisition plans.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Market research</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Before proceeding with an acquisition strategy that could lead to a contract containing consolidated procurement requirements, the head of an agency shall conduct market research to determine whether consolidation of the requirements is necessary and justified.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Factors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraph (A), consolidation of the requirements may be determined as being necessary and justified if, as compared to the benefits that would be derived from contracting to meet those requirements if not consolidated, the Federal Government would derive from the consolidation measurably substantial benefits, including any combination of benefits that, in combination, are measurably substantial. Benefits described in the preceding sentence may include the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) Cost savings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) Quality improvements.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) Reduction in acquisition cycle times.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) Better terms and conditions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) Any other benefits.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Reduction of costs not determinative</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The reduction of administrative or personnel costs alone shall not be a justification for bundling of contract requirements unless the cost savings are expected to be substantial in relation to the dollar value of the procurement requirements to be consolidated.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Strategy specifications</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the head of a contracting agency determines that an acquisition plan for a procurement involves a substantial bundling of contract requirements, the head of a contracting agency shall publish a notice on a public website that such determination has been made not later than 7 days after making such determination. Any solicitation for a procurement related to the acquisition plan may not be published earlier than 7 days after such notice is published. Along with the publication of the solicitation, the head of a contracting agency shall publish a justification for the determination, which shall include the following information:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The specific benefits anticipated to be derived from the bundling of contract requirements and a determination that such benefits justify the bundling.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) An identification of any alternative contracting approaches that would involve a lesser degree of bundling of contract requirements.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) An assessment of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the specific impediments to participation by small business concerns as prime contractors that result from the bundling of contract requirements; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the specific actions designed to maximize participation of small business concerns as subcontractors (including suppliers) at various tiers under the contract or contracts that are awarded to meet the requirements.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Contract teaming</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a solicitation of offers for a bundled or consolidated contract that is issued by the head of an agency, a small business concern that provides for use of a particular team of subcontractors or a joint venture of small business concerns may submit an offer for the performance of the contract.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Evaluation of offers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The head of the agency shall evaluate an offer described in subparagraph (A) in the same manner as other offers, with due consideration to the capabilities of all of the proposed subcontractors or members of the joint venture as follows:</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Teams</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">When evaluating an offer of a small business prime contractor that includes a proposed team of small business subcontractors, the head of the agency shall consider <!-- PDFPage:976 -->the capabilities and past performance of each first tier subcontractor that is part of the team as the capabilities and past performance of the small business prime contractor.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Joint ventures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">When evaluating an offer of a joint venture of small business concerns, if the joint venture does not demonstrate sufficient capabilities or past performance to be considered for award of a contract opportunity, the head of the agency shall consider the capabilities and past performance of each member of the joint venture as the capabilities and past performance of the joint venture.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Status as a small business concern</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Participation of a small business concern in a team or a joint venture under this paragraph shall not affect the status of that concern as a small business concern for any other purpose.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Past performance ratings of joint ventures for small business concerns</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">With respect to evaluating an offer for a prime contract made by a small business concern that previously participated in a joint venture with another business concern (whether or not such other business concern was a small business concern), the Administrator shall establish regulations&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) allowing the small business concern to elect to use the past performance of the joint venture if the small business concern has no relevant past performance of its own;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) requiring the small business concern, when making an election under subparagraph (A)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) to identify to the contracting officer the joint venture of which the small business concern was a member; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) to inform the contracting officer what duties and responsibilities the small business concern carried out as part of the joint venture; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) requiring a contracting officer, if the small business concern makes an election under subparagraph (A), to consider the past performance of the joint venture when evaluating the past performance of the small business concern, giving due consideration to the information provided under subparagraph (B)(ii).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Contracting preference for small business concerns in a major disaster area</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Definition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In this subsection, the term &quot;disaster area&quot; means the area for which the President has declared a major disaster, during the period of the declaration.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Contracting preference</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An agency shall provide a contracting preference for a small business concern located in a disaster area if the small business concern will perform the work required under the contract in the disaster area.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Credit for meeting contracting goals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If an agency awards a contract to a small business concern under the circumstances described in paragraph (2), the value of the contract shall be doubled for purposes of determining compliance with the goals for procurement contracts under subsection (g)(1)(A).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Goals for participation of small business concerns in procurement contracts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) <cap-smallcap>Governmentwide goals.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) <cap-smallcap>Establishment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The President shall annually establish Governmentwide goals for procurement contracts awarded to small business concerns, small business concerns owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans, qualified HUBZone small business concerns, small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and small business concerns owned and controlled by women in accordance with the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) The Governmentwide goal for participation by small business concerns shall be established at not less than 23 percent of the total value of all prime contract awards for each fiscal year. In meeting this goal, the Government shall ensure the participation of small business concerns from a wide variety of industries and from a broad spectrum of small business concerns within each industry.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) The Governmentwide goal for participation by small business concerns owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans shall be established at not less than 5 percent of the total value of all prime contract and subcontract awards for each fiscal year.</p>

Such goals shall separately address prime contract awards and subcontract awards for each category of small business covered.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Goals established under this subsection shall be jointly established by the Administration and the head of each Federal agency and shall realistically reflect the potential of small business concerns, small business concerns owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans, qualified HUBZone small business concerns, small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and small business concerns owned and controlled by women to perform such contracts and to perform subcontracts under such contracts. Contracts excluded from review by procurement center representatives pursuant to subsection (l)(9)(B) shall not be considered when establishing these goals.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Whenever the Administration and the head of any Federal agency fail to agree on established goals, the disagreement shall be submitted to the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy for final determination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) After establishing goals under this paragraph for a fiscal year, the head of each Federal agency shall develop a plan for achieving such goals at both the prime contract and the subcontract level, which shall apportion responsibilities among the agency's acquisition executives and officials. In establishing goals under this paragraph, the head of each Federal agency shall make a consistent effort to annually expand participation by small business concerns from each industry category in procurement contracts and subcontracts of such agency, including participation by small business concerns owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans, qualified HUBZone small business concerns, small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and small business concerns owned and controlled by women.</p>

<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 631 <i>et seq</i>.), section 7102 of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 (Public Law 103&ndash;355, 15 U.S.C. 644 note), the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act ([former] 41 U.S.C. 403 <i>et seq</i>.), Executive Order 11625 [15 U.S.C. 631 note], and to provide for increased access for disadvantaged businesses to Federal contracting opportunities, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1000 --><p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <i>Policy</i>. It is the policy of the executive branch to ensure nondiscrimination in Federal procurement opportunities for businesses in the Small Disadvantaged Business Program (SDBs), businesses in the section 8(a) Business Development program of the Small Business Administration (8(a)s), and Minority Business Enterprises (MBEs) as defined in section 6 of Executive Order 11625, of October 13, 1971, and to take affirmative action to ensure inclusion of these businesses in Federal contracting. These businesses are of vital importance to job growth and the economic strength of the United States but have faced historic exclusion and underutilization in Federal procurement. All agencies within the executive branch with procurement authority are required to take all necessary steps, as permitted by law, to increase contracting between the Federal Government and SDBs, 8(a)s, and MBEs.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <i>Responsibilities of Executive Departments and Agencies with Procurement Authority</i>. The head of each executive department and agency shall carry out the terms of this order and shall designate, where appropriate, his or her Deputy Secretary or equivalent to implement the terms of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) Each department and agency with procurement authority shall:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(i) aggressively seek to ensure that 8(a)s, SDBs, and MBEs are aware of future prime contracting opportunities through wide dissemination of contract announcements, including sources likely to reach 8(a)s, SDBs, other small businesses, and MBEs. Each department and agency shall use all available forms of communication to implement this provision, including the Internet, speciality press, and trade press;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(ii) work with the Small Business Administration (SBA) to ensure that information regarding sole source contracts awarded through the section 8(a) program receives the widest dissemination possible to 8(a)s;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(iii) ensure that the price evaluation preference programs authorized by the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 [Pub. L. 103&ndash;355, see Tables for classification] are used to the maximum extent permitted by law in areas of economic activity in which SDBs have historically been underused;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(iv) aggressively use the firms in the section 8(a) program, particularly in the developmental stage of the program, so that these firms have an opportunity to overcome artificial barriers to Federal contracting and gain access to the Federal procurement arena;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(v) ensure that department and agency heads take all reasonable steps so that prime contractors meet or exceed Federal subcontracting goals, and enforce subcontracting commitments as required by the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d)) and other related laws. In particular, they shall ensure that prime contractors actively solicit bids for subcontracting opportunities from 8(a)s and SDBs, and fulfill their SDB and section 8(d) subcontracting obligations. Enforcement of SDB subcontracting plan commitments shall include assessments of liquidated damages, where appropriate, pursuant to applicable contract clauses;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(vi) encourage the establishment of business-to-business mentoring and teaming relationships, including the implementation of Mentor-Protege programs, to foster the development of the technical and managerial capabilities of 8(a)s and SDBs and to facilitate long-term business relationships;</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">(viii) train program and procurement officials regarding the policy of including 8(a)s and SDBs in Federal procurement. This includes prescribing procedures to ensure that acquisition planners, to the maximum extent practicable, structure acquisitions to facilitate competition by SDBs and 8(a)s, including their participation in the competition of multiple award requirements;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(ix) provide the information required by the Department of Commerce when it requests data to develop the benchmarks used in the price evaluation preference programs authorized by the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(x) ensure that Directors of Offices of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization carry out their responsibilities to maximize the participation of 8(a)s and SDBs in Federal procurement and, in particular, ensure that the Directors report directly to the head of each department or agency as required by law; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(xi) as required by law, establish with the Small Business Administration small business goals to ensure that the government-wide goal for participation of small business concerns is not less than 23 percent of Federal prime contracts.

Each agency shall also establish a goal for awards made to 8(a) firms pursuant to section 8(a) of the Small Business Act [15 U.S.C. 637(a)]. These goals shall be considered the minimum goals and every effort shall be taken to exceed these goals wherever feasible.</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">(ii) annually, by April 30 each year, assess its efforts and the results of those efforts to increase utilization of 8(a)s, SDBs, and MBEs as both prime contractors and subcontractors and report on those efforts to the President through the Director of OMB, who shall review the evaluations made of the agency assessments by the Small Business Administration.</p>

<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <i>Federal Advertising</i>. Each department or agency that contracts with businesses to develop advertising for the department or agency or to broadcast Federal advertising shall take an aggressive role in ensuring substantial minority-owned entities&apos; participation, including 8(a), SDB, and MBE, in Federal advertising-related procurements.

To achieve this diversity, special attention shall be given to ensure placement in publications and television and radio stations that <!-- PDFPage:1001 -->reach specific ethnic and racial audiences. Each department and agency shall ensure that payment for Federal advertising is commensurate with fair market rates in the relevant market. Each department and agency shall structure advertising contracts as commercial acquisitions consistent with part 12 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation processes and paperwork to enhance participation by 8(a)s, SDBs, and MBEs.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. <i>Information Technology</i>.

In so doing, the Chief Information Officer in each department and agency shall coordinate with procurement officials to implement this section.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 6. <i>General Services Administration Schedules</i>. The SBA and the General Services Administration (GSA) shall act promptly to expand inclusion of 8(a)s and SDBs on GSA Schedules, and provide greater opportunities for 8(a) and SDB participation in orders under such schedules.

The GSA shall allow agencies ordering from designated 8(a) firms under the Multiple Award Schedule to count those orders toward their 8(a) procurement goals.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 7. <i>Bundling Contracts</i>. To the extent permitted by law, departments and agencies must submit to the SBA for review any contracts that are proposed to be bundled.

<p class="note-body">Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies [and] the President's Management Council</p>
<p class="note-body">It is the policy of the Federal Government that a fair proportion of its contracts be placed with small, small disadvantaged, and small women-owned businesses. Such businesses should also have the maximum practicable opportunity to participate as subcontractors in contracts awarded by the Federal Government consistent with efficient contract performance. I am committed to the continuation of this policy. Therefore, I ask that you encourage the use of various tools, including set-asides, price preferences, and section 8(a) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(a)), as necessary to achieve this policy objective.</p>

The Act also, for the first time, establishes goals for contracting with small women-owned businesses. These provisions, along with others in the Act, will provide greater access to Federal Government business opportunities for small, small disadvantaged, and small women-owned businesses.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the term &quot;consolidation of contract requirements&quot;, with respect to contract requirements of a Federal agency, means a use of a solicitation to obtain offers for a single contract or a multiple award contract&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to satisfy 2 or more requirements of the Federal agency for goods or services that have been provided to or performed for the Federal agency under 2 or more separate contracts lower in cost than the total cost of the contract for which the offers are solicited; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to satisfy requirements of the Federal agency for construction projects to be performed at 2 or more discrete sites; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the term &quot;senior procurement executive&quot; means an official designated under section 1702(c) of title 41 as the senior procurement executive for a Federal agency.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The head of each Federal agency shall ensure that the decisions made by the Federal agency regarding consolidation of contract requirements of the Federal agency are made with a view to providing small business concerns with appropriate opportunities to participate as prime contractors and subcontractors in the procurements of the Federal agency.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Limitation on use of acquisition strategies involving consolidation</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The head of a Federal agency may not carry out an acquisition strategy that includes a consolidation of contract requirements of the Federal agency with a total value of more <!-- PDFPage:1075 -->than $2,000,000, unless the senior procurement executive or Chief Acquisition Officer for the Federal agency, before carrying out the acquisition strategy&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) conducts market research;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) identifies any alternative contracting approaches that would involve a lesser degree of consolidation of contract requirements;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) identifies any negative impact by the acquisition strategy on contracting with small business concerns; and</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A senior procurement executive or Chief Acquisition Officer may determine that an acquisition strategy involving a consolidation of contract requirements is necessary and justified for the purposes of paragraph (1)(C) if the benefits of the acquisition strategy substantially exceed the benefits of each of the possible alternative contracting approaches identified under paragraph (1)(B).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Savings in administrative or personnel costs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraph (A), savings in administrative or personnel costs alone do not constitute a sufficient justification for a consolidation of contract requirements in a procurement unless the expected total amount of the cost savings, as determined by the senior procurement executive or Chief Acquisition Officer, is expected to be substantial in relation to the total cost of the procurement.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Not later than 7 days after making a determination that an acquisition strategy involving a consolidation of contract requirements is necessary and justified under subparagraph (A), the senior procurement executive or Chief Acquisition Officer shall publish a notice on a public website that such determination has been made. Any solicitation for a procurement related to the acquisition strategy may not be published earlier than 7 days after such notice is published. Along with the publication of the solicitation, the senior procurement executive or Chief Acquisition Officer shall publish a justification for the determination, which shall include the information in subparagraphs (A) through (E) of paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Benefits to be considered</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The benefits considered for the purposes of paragraphs (1) and (2) may include cost and, regardless of whether quantifiable in dollar amounts&mdash;</p>
