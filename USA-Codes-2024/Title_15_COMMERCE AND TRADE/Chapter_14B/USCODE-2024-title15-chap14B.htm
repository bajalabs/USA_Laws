<p class="statutory-body">It is declared to be the policy of the Congress and the purpose of this chapter to improve and stimulate the national economy in general and the small-business segment thereof in particular by establishing a program to stimulate and supplement the flow of private equity capital and long-term loan funds which small-business concerns need for the sound financing of their business operations and for their growth, expansion, and modernization, and which are not available in adequate supply: <i>Provided, however</i>, That this policy shall be carried out in such manner as to insure the maximum participation of private financing sources.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the intention of the Congress that the provisions of this chapter shall be so administered that any financial assistance provided hereunder shall not result in a substantial increase of unemployment in any area of the country. It is the intention of the Congress that in the award of financial assistance under this chapter, when practicable, priority be accorded to small business concerns which lease or purchase equipment and supplies which are produced in the United States and that small business concerns receiving such assistance be encouraged to continue to lease or purchase such equipment and supplies.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) The maximum amount of outstanding leverage made available to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) any 1 company described in clause (iii) may not exceed the lesser of 300 percent of private capital of the company, or $175,000,000; and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Guarantee of payment of and authority to purchase participating securities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to encourage small business investment companies to provide equity capital to small businesses, the Administration is authorized to guarantee the payment of the redemption price and prioritized payments on participating securities issued by such companies which are licensed pursuant to section 681(c) of this title, and a trust or a pool acting on behalf of the Administration is authorized to purchase such securities. Such guarantees and purchases shall be made on such terms and conditions as the Administration shall establish by regulation. For purposes of this section, (A) the term &quot;participating securities&quot; includes preferred stock, a preferred limited partnership interest or a similar instrument, including debentures under the terms of which interest is payable only to the extent of earnings and (B) the term &quot;prioritized payments&quot; includes dividends on stock, interest on qualifying debentures, or priority returns on preferred limited partnership interests which are paid only to the extent of earnings. Participating securities guaranteed under this subsection shall be subject to the following restrictions and limitations, in addition to such other restrictions and limitations as the Administration may determine:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Participating securities shall be redeemed not later than 15 years after their date of issuance for an amount equal to 100 per centum of the original issue price plus the amount of any accrued prioritized payment: <i>Provided</i>, That if, at the time the securities are redeemed, whether as scheduled or in advance, the issuing company (A) has not paid all accrued prioritized payments in full as provided in paragraph (2) below and (B) has not sold or otherwise disposed of all investments subject to profit distributions pursuant to paragraph (11), the company's obligation to pay accrued and unpaid prioritized payments shall continue and payment shall be made from the realized gain, if any, on the disposition of such investments, but if on disposition there is no realized gain, the obligation to pay accrued and unpaid prioritized payments shall be extinguished: <i>Provided further</i>, That in the interim, the company shall not make any in-kind distributions of such investments unless it pays to the Administration such sums, up to the amount of the unrealized appreciation on such investments, as may be necessary to pay in full the accrued prioritized payments.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Prioritized payments on participating securities shall be preferred and cumulative and payable out of the retained earnings available for distribution, as defined by the Administration, of the issuing company at a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury taking into consideration the current average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with remaining periods to maturity comparable to the average maturities on such securities, adjusted to the nearest one-eighth of 1 percent, plus, for participating securities obligated after September 30, 2001, an additional charge, in an amount established annually by the Administration, as necessary to reduce to zero the cost (as defined in section 661a of title 2) to the Administration of purchasing and guaranteeing participating securities under this chapter, which amount may not exceed 1.46 percent per year, and which shall be paid to and retained by the Administration.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) In the event of liquidation of the company, participating securities shall be senior in priority for all purposes to all other equity interests in the issuing company, whenever created.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Any company issuing a participating security under this chapter shall commit to invest or shall invest an amount equal to the outstanding face value of such security solely in equity capital. As used in this subsection, &quot;equity capital&quot; means common or preferred stock or a similar instrument, including subordinated debt with equity features which is not amortized and which provides for interest payments from appropriate sources, as determined by the Administration.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The only debt (other than leverage obtained in accordance with this subchapter) which any company issuing a participating security under this subsection may have outstanding shall be temporary debt in amounts limited to not more than 50 per centum of private capital.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The Administration may permit the proceeds of a participating security to be used to pay the principal amount due on outstanding debentures guaranteed by the Administration, if (A) the company has outstanding equity capital invested in an amount equal to the amount of the debentures being refinanced and (B) the Administration receives profit partici<!-- PDFPage:1094 -->pation on such terms and conditions as it may determine, but not to exceed the per centums specified in paragraph (11).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) For purposes of computing profit participation under paragraph (11), except as otherwise determined by the Administration, the management expenses of any company which issues participating securities shall not be greater than 2.5 per centum per annum of the combined capital of the company, plus $125,000 if the company's combined capital is less than $20,000,000. For purposes of this paragraph, (A) the term &quot;combined capital&quot; means the aggregate amount of private capital and outstanding leverage and (B) the term &quot;management expenses&quot; includes salaries, office expenses, travel, business development, office and equipment rental, bookkeeping and the development, investigation and monitoring of investments, but does not include the cost of services provided by specialized outside consultants, outside lawyers and outside auditors, who perform services not generally expected of a venture capital company nor does such term include the cost of services provided by any affiliate of the company which are not part of the normal process of making and monitoring venture capital investments.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) Notwithstanding paragraph (9), if a company is operating as a limited partnership or as a subchapter S corporation or an equivalent pass-through entity for tax purposes and if there are no accumulated and unpaid prioritized payments, the company may make annual distributions to the partners, shareholders, or members in amounts not greater than each partner's, shareholder's, or member's maximum tax liability. For purposes of this paragraph, the term &quot;maximum tax liability&quot; means the amount of income allocated to each partner, shareholder, or member (including an allocation to the Administration as if it were a taxpayer) for Federal income tax purposes in the income tax return filed or to be filed by the company with respect to the fiscal year of the company immediately preceding such distribution, multiplied by the highest combined marginal Federal and State income tax rates for corporations or individuals, whichever is higher, on each type of income included in such return. For purposes of this paragraph, the term &quot;State income tax&quot; means the income tax of the State where the company's principal place of business is located. A company may also elect to make a distribution under this paragraph at any time during any calendar quarter based on an estimate of the maximum tax liability. If a company makes 1 or more interim distributions for a calendar year, and the aggregate amount of those distributions exceeds the maximum amount that the company could have distributed based on a single annual computation, any subsequent distribution by the company under this paragraph shall be reduced by an amount equal to the excess amount distributed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) After making any distributions as provided in paragraph (8), a company with participating securities outstanding may distribute the balance of income to its investors, specifically including the Administration, in the per centums specified in paragraph (11), if there are no accumulated and unpaid prioritized payments and if all amounts due the Administration pursuant to paragraph (11) have been paid in full, subject to the following conditions:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) As of the date of the proposed distribution, if the amount of leverage outstanding is more than 200 per centum of the amount of private capital, any amounts distributed shall be made to private investors and to the Administration in the ratio of leverage to private capital.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) As of the date of the proposed distribution, if the amount of leverage outstanding is more than 100 per centum but not more than 200 per centum of the amount of private capital, 50 per centum of any amounts distributed shall be made to the Administration and 50 per centum shall be made to the private investors.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) If the amount of leverage outstanding is 100 per centum, or less, of the amount of private capital, the ratio shall be that for distribution of profits as provided in paragraph (11).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) Any amounts received by the Administration under subparagraph (A) or (B) shall be applied first as profit participation as provided in paragraph (11) and any remainder shall be applied as a prepayment of the principal amount of the participating securities or debentures.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) After making any distributions pursuant to paragraph (8), a company with participating securities outstanding may return capital to its investors, specifically including the Administration, if there are no accumulated and unpaid prioritized payments and if all amounts due the Administration pursuant to paragraph (11) have been paid in full. Any distributions under this paragraph shall be made to private investors and to the Administration in the ratio of private capital to leverage as of the date of the proposed distribution: <i>Provided</i>, That if the amount of leverage outstanding is less than 50 per centum of the amount of private capital or $10,000,000, whichever is less, no distribution shall be required to be made to the Administration unless the Administration determines, on a case by case basis, to require distributions to the Administration to reduce the amount of outstanding leverage to an amount less than $10,000,000.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11)(A) A company which issues participating securities shall agree to allocate to the Administration a share of its profits determined by the relationship of its private capital to the amount of participating securities guaranteed by the Administration in accordance with the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) If the total amount of participating securities is 100 per centum of private capital or less, the company shall allocate to the Administration a per centum share computed as follows: the amount of participating securities divided by private capital times 9 per centum.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) If the total amount of participating securities is more than 100 per centum but not <!-- PDFPage:1095 -->greater than 200 per centum of private capital, the company shall allocate to the Administration a per centum share computed as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) 9 per centum, plus</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) 3 per centum of the amount of participating securities minus private capital divided by private capital.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) in no event shall the total per centum required by this paragraph exceed 12 per centum, unless required pursuant to the provisions of (ii) below,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) if, on the date the participating securities are marketed, the interest rate on Treasury bonds with a maturity of 10 years is a rate other than 8 per centum, the Administration shall adjust the rate specified in paragraph (A) above, either higher or lower, by the same per centum by which the Treasury bond rate is higher or lower than 8 per centum, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) this paragraph shall not be construed to create any ownership interest of the Administration in the company.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) A company may elect to make an in-kind distribution of securities only if such securities are publicly traded and marketable. The company shall deposit the Administration's share of such securities for disposition with a trustee designated by the Administration or, at its option and with the agreement of the company, the Administration may direct the company to retain the Administration's share. If the company retains the Administration's share, it shall sell the Administration's share and promptly remit the proceeds to the Administration. As used in this paragraph, the term &quot;trustee&quot; means a person who is knowledgeable about and proficient in the marketing of thinly traded securities.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Computation of amounts due under participating securities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The computation of amounts due the Administration under participating securities shall be subject to the following terms and conditions:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The formula in subsection (g)(11) shall be computed annually and the Administration shall receive distributions of its profit participation at the same time as other investors in the company.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The formula shall not be modified due to an increase in the private capital unless the increase is provided for in a proposed business plan submitted to and approved by the Administration.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) After distributions have been made, the Administration's share of such distributions shall not be recomputed or reduced.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) If the company prepays or repays the participating securities, the Administration shall receive the requisite participation upon the distribution of profits due to any investments held by the company on the date of the repayment or prepayment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) If a company is licensed on or before March 31, 1993, it may elect to exclude from profit participation all investments held on that date and in such case the Administration shall determine the amount of the future expenses attributable to such prior investment: <i>Provided</i>, That if the company issues participating securities to refinance debentures as authorized in subsection (g)(6), it may not elect to exclude profits on existing investments under this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Leverage fee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">With respect to leverage granted by the Administration to a licensee, the Administration shall collect from the licensee a nonrefundable fee in an amount equal to 3 percent of the face amount of leverage granted to the licensee in the following manner: 1 percent upon the date on which the Administration enters into any commitment for such leverage with the licensee, and the balance of 2 percent (or 3 percent if no commitment has been entered into by the Administration) on the date on which the leverage is drawn by the licensee.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Calculation of subsidy rate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">All fees, interest, and profits received and retained by the Administration under this section shall be included in the calculations made by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to offset the cost (as that term is defined in section 661a of title 2) to the Administration of purchasing and guaranteeing debentures and participating securities under this chapter.</p>

In this paragraph, the term &quot;interest&quot; includes only the maximum mandatory sum, expressed in dollars or as a percentage rate, that is payable with respect to the business loan amount received by the small business concern, and does not include the value, if any, of contingent obligations, including warrants, royalty, or conversion rights, granting the small business investment company an ownership interest in the equity or increased future revenue of the small business concern receiving the business loan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A State law or constitutional provision shall be preempted for purposes of paragraph (2) with respect to any loan if such loan is made before the date, on or after April 1, 1980, on which such State adopts a law or certifies that the voters of such State have voted in favor of any provision, constitutional or otherwise, which states <!-- PDFPage:1103 -->explicitly and by its terms that such State does not want the provisions of this subsection to apply with respect to loans made in such State, except that such State law or constitutional or other provision shall be preempted in the case of a loan made, on or after the date on which such law is adopted or such certification is made, pursuant to a commitment to make such loan which was entered into on or after April 1, 1980, and prior to the date on which such law is adopted or such certification is made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) If the maximum rate of interest authorized under paragraph (2) on any loan made by a small business investment company exceeds the rate which would be authorized by applicable State law if such State law were not preempted for purposes of this subsection, the charging of interest at any rate in excess of the rate authorized by paragraph (2) shall be deemed a forfeiture of the greater of (i) all interest which the loan carries with it, or (ii) all interest which has been agreed to be paid thereon.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In the case of any loan with respect to which there is a forfeiture of interest under subparagraph (A), the person who paid the interest may recover from a small business investment company making such loan an amount equal to twice the amount of the interest paid on such loan. Such interest may be recovered in a civil action commenced in a court of appropriate jurisdiction not later than two years after the most recent payment of interest.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">A license may be revoked or suspended by the Administration&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) for false statements knowingly made in any written statement required under this subchapter, or under any regulation issued under this subchapter by the Administration;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if any written statement required under this subchapter, or under any regulation issued under this subchapter by the Administrator, fails to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statement not misleading in the light of the circumstances under which the statement was made;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) for willful or repeated violation of, or willful or repeated failure to observe, any provision of this chapter;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Where a licensee or any other person has not complied with any provision of this chapter, or of any regulation issued pursuant thereto by the Administration, or is engaging or is about to engage in any acts or practices which constitute or will constitute a violation of such chapter or regulation, the Administration may order such licensee or other person to cease and desist from such action or failure to act. The Administration may further order such licensee or other person to take such action or to refrain from such action as the Administration deems necessary to insure compliance with this chapter and the regulations. The Administration may also suspend the license of a licensee, against whom an order has been issued, until such licensee complies with such order.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Order to show cause; contents; hearing; issuance and service</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Before revoking or suspending a license pursuant to subsection (a), or issuing a cease and desist order pursuant to subsection (b), the Administration shall serve upon the licensee and any other person involved an order to show cause why an order revoking or suspending the license or a cease and desist order should not be issued. Any such order to show cause shall contain a statement of the matters of fact and law asserted by the Administration and the legal authority and jurisdiction under which a hearing is to be held, and shall set forth that a hearing will be held before the Administration at a time and place stated in the order. If after hearing, or a waiver thereof, the Administration determines on the record that an order revoking or suspending the license or a cease and desist order should issue, it shall promptly issue such order, which shall include a statement of the findings of the Administration and the grounds and reasons therefor and specify the effective date of the order, and shall cause the order to be served on the licensee and any other person involved.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Petition to modify or set aside order; filing, time and place, Administration to submit record; action of court; review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An order issued by the Administration under this section shall be final and conclusive unless within thirty days after the service thereof the licensee, or other person against whom an order is issued, appeals to the United States court of appeals for the circuit in which such licensee has its principal place of business by filing with the clerk of such court a petition praying that the Administration's order be set aside or modified in the manner stated in the petition. After the expiration of such thirty days, a petition may be filed only by leave of court on a showing <!-- PDFPage:1106 -->of reasonable grounds for failure to file the petition theretofore. The clerk of the court shall immediately cause a copy of the petition to be delivered to the Administration, and the Administration shall thereupon certify and file in the court a transcript of the record upon which the order complained of was entered. If before such record is filed the Administration amends or sets aside its order, in whole or in part, the petitioner may amend the petition within such time as the court may determine, on notice to the Administration. The filing of a petition for review shall not of itself stay or suspend the operation of the order of the Administration, but the court of appeals in its discretion may restrain or suspend, in whole or in part, the operation of the order pending the final hearing and determination of the petition. The court may affirm, modify, or set aside the order of the Administration. If the court determines that the just and proper disposition of the case requires the taking of additional evidence, the court shall order the Administration to reopen the hearing for the taking of such evidence, in such manner and upon such terms and conditions as the court may deem proper. The Administration may modify its findings as to the facts, or make new findings, by reason of the additional evidence so taken, and it shall file its modified or new findings and the amendments, if any, of its order, with the record of such additional evidence. No objection to an order of the Administration shall be considered by the court unless such objection was urged before the Administration or, if it was not so urged, unless there were reasonable grounds for failure to do so. The judgment and decree of the court affirming, modifying, or setting aside any such order of the Administration shall be subject only to review by the Supreme Court of the United States upon certification or certiorari as provided in section 1254 of title 28.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Enforcement of order</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If any licensee or other person against which or against whom an order is issued under this section fails to obey the order, the Administration may apply to the United States court of appeals, within the circuit where the licensee has its principal place of business, for the enforcement of the order, and shall file a transcript of the record upon which the order complained of was entered. Upon the filing of the application the court shall cause notice thereof to be served on the licensee or other person. The evidence to be considered, the procedure to be followed, and the jurisdiction of the court shall be the same as is provided in subsection (e) for applications to set aside or modify orders.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Investigation of violations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administration may make such investigations as it deems necessary to determine whether a licensee or any other person has engaged or is about to engage in any acts or practices which constitute or will constitute a violation of any provision of this chapter, or of any rule or regulation under this chapter, or of any order issued under this chapter. The Administration shall permit any person to file with it a statement in writing, under oath or otherwise as the Administration shall determine, as to all the facts and circumstances concerning the matter to be investigated. For the purpose of any investigation, the Administration is empowered to administer oaths and affirmations, subpena witnesses, compel their attendance, take evidence, and require the production of any books, papers, and documents which are relevant to the inquiry. Such attendance of witnesses and the production of any such records may be required from any place in the United States. In case of contumacy by, or refusal to obey a subpena issued to, any person, including a licensee, the Administration may invoke the aid of any court of the United States within the jurisdiction of which such investigation or proceeding is carried on, or where <!-- PDFPage:1107 -->such person resides or carries on business, in requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of books, papers, and documents; and such court may issue an order requiring such person to appear before the Administration, there to produce records, if so ordered, or to give testimony touching the matter under investigation. Any failure to obey such order of the court may be punished by such court as a contempt thereof. All process in any such case may be served in the judicial district whereof such person is an inhabitant or wherever he may be found.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Examinations and reports</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each small business investment company shall be subject to examinations made by direction of the Investment Division of the Administration, which may be conducted with the assistance of a private sector entity that has both the qualifications to conduct and expertise in conducting such examinations, and the cost of such examinations, including the compensation of the examiners, may in the discretion of the Administration be assessed against the company examined and when so assessed shall be paid by such company. Fees collected under this subsection shall be deposited in the account for salaries and expenses of the Administration, and are authorized to be appropriated solely to cover the costs of examinations and other program oversight activities. Every such company shall make such reports to the Administration at such times and in such form as the Administration may require; except that the Administration is authorized to exempt from making such reports any such company which is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 [15 U.S.C. 80a&ndash;1 et seq.] to the extent necessary to avoid duplication in reporting requirements.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Examinations of small business investment companies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each small business investment company shall be examined at least every two years in such detail so as to determine whether or not&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) it has engaged solely in lawful activities and those contemplated by this subchapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) it has engaged in prohibited conflicts of interest;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) it has acquired or exercised illegal control of an assisted small business;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) it has made investments in small businesses for not less than 1 year;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) it has invested more than 20 per centum of its capital in any individual small business, if such restriction is applicable;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) it has engaged in relending, foreign investments, or passive investments; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) it has charged an interest rate in excess of the maximum permitted by law:</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block"><i>Provided</i>, That the Administration may waive the examination (A) for up to one additional year if, in its discretion, it determines such a delay would be appropriate, based upon the amount of debentures being issued by the company and its repayment record, the prior operating experience of the company, the contents and results of the last examination and the management expertise of the company, or (B) if it is a company whose operations have been suspended while the company is involved in litigation or is in receivership.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Valuations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Frequency of valuations</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Each licensee shall submit to the Administrator a written valuation of the loans and investments of the licensee not less often than semiannually or otherwise upon the request of the Administrator, except that any licensee with no leverage outstanding shall submit such valuations annually, unless the Administrator determines otherwise.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Material adverse changes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Not later than 30 days after the end of a fiscal quarter of a licensee during which a material adverse change in the aggregate valuation of the loans and investments or operations of the licensee occurs, the licensee shall notify the Administrator in writing of the nature and extent of that change.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Independent certification</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Not less than once during each fiscal year, each licensee shall submit to the Administrator the financial statements of the licensee, audited by an independent certified public accountant approved by the Administrator.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Audit requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Each audit conducted under clause (i) shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) a review of the procedures and documentation used by the licensee in preparing the valuations required by this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) a statement by the independent certified public accountant that such valuations were prepared in conformity with the valuation criteria applicable to the licensee established in accordance with paragraph (2).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Valuation criteria</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each valuation submitted under this subsection shall be prepared by the licensee in accordance with valuation criteria, which shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) be established or approved by the Administrator; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) include appropriate safeguards to ensure that the noncash assets of a licensee are not overvalued.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Nonavailability of guarantees from other sources; participation with qualified sureties</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administration may, whenever it determines such action to be necessary or desirable, and upon such terms and conditions as it may prescribe, guarantee the payment of rentals under leases of commercial and industrial property entered into by small business concerns to enable such concerns to obtain such leases. Any such guarantee may be made or effected either directly or in cooperation with any qualified surety company or other qualified company through a participation agreement with such company. The foregoing powers shall be subject, however, to the following restrictions and limitations:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) No guarantee shall be issued by the Administration (A) if a guarantee meeting the requirements of the applicant is otherwise available on reasonable terms, and (B) unless the Administration determines that there exists a reasonable expectation that the small business concern in behalf of which the guarantee is issued will perform the covenants and conditions of the lease.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The Administration shall, to the greatest extent practicable, exercise the powers conferred by this section in cooperation with qualified surety or other companies on a participation basis.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Uniform annual fee; processing fees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administration shall fix a uniform annual fee for its share of any guarantee under this section which shall be payable in advance at such time as may be prescribed by the Administrator. The amount of any such fee shall be determined in accordance with sound actuarial practices and procedures, to the extent practicable, but in no case shall such amount exceed, on the Administration's share of any guarantee made under this part, 2&#189; per centum per annum of the minimum annual guaranteed rental payable under any guaranteed lease: <i>Provided</i>, That the Administration shall fix the lowest fee that experience under the program established hereby has shown to be justified. The Administration may also fix such uniform fees for the processing of applications for guarantees under this section as the Administrator determines are reasonable and necessary to pay the administra<!-- PDFPage:1128 -->tive expenses that are incurred in connection therewith.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Escrow; default; additional discretionary provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In connection with the guarantee of rentals under any lease pursuant to authority conferred by this section, the Administrator may require, in order to minimize the financial risk assumed under such guarantee&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) that the lessee pay an amount, not to exceed one-fourth of the minimum guaranteed annual rental required under the lease, which shall be held in escrow and shall be available (A) to meet rental charges accruing in any month for which the lessee is in default, or (B) if no default occurs during the term of the lease, for application (with accrued interest) toward final payments of rental charges under the lease;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) that upon occurrence of a default under the lease, the lessor shall, as a condition precedent to enforcing any claim under the lease guarantee, utilize the entire period, for which there are funds available in escrow for payment of rentals, in reasonably diligent efforts to eliminate or minimize losses, by releasing the commercial or industrial property covered by the lease to another qualified tenant, and no claim shall be made or paid under the guarantee until such effort has been made and such escrow funds have been exhausted;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) that any guarantor of the lease will become a successor of the lessor for the purpose of collecting from a lessee in default rentals which are in arrears and with respect to which the lessor has received payment under a guarantee made pursuant to this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) such other provisions, not inconsistent with the purposes of this part, as the Administrator may in his discretion require.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) &quot;pollution control facilities&quot; means such property (both real and personal) as the Administration in its discretion determines is likely to help prevent, reduce, abate, or control noise, air or water pollution or contamination by removing, altering, disposing or storing pollutants, contaminants, wastes, or heat, and such property (both real and personal) as the Administration determines will be used for the collection, storage, treatment, utilization, processing, or final disposal of solid or liquid waste.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) &quot;person&quot; includes corporations, companies, associations, firms, partnerships, societies, joint stock companies, States, territories, and possessions of the United States, or subdivisions of any of the foregoing, and the District of Columbia, as well as individuals.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) &quot;qualified contract&quot; means a lease, sublease, loan agreement, installment sales contract, or similar instrument, entered into between a small business concern and any person.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1129 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Financing disadvantage; guarantee of payment by Administration; restrictions and limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administration may, whenever it determines that small business concerns are or are likely to be at an operational or financing disadvantage with other business concerns with respect to the planning, design, or installation of pollution control facilities, or the obtaining of financing therefor (including financing by means of revenue bonds issued by States, political subdivisions thereof, or other public bodies), guarantee the payment of rentals or other amounts due under qualified contracts. Any such guarantee may be made or effected either directly or in cooperation with any qualified surety company or other qualified company through a participation agreement with such company. The foregoing powers shall be subject, however, to the following restrictions and limitations:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Notwithstanding any other law, rule, or regulation or fiscal policy to the contrary, the guarantee authorized in the case of pollution control facilities or property shall be issued when such property is acquired by the use of proceeds from industrial revenue bonds which provide the holders interest which is exempt from Federal income tax, and the Administration is expressly prohibited from denying such guarantee due to the property being so acquired.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Any such guarantee shall be for the full amount of the payments due under such qualified contract and shall be a full faith and credit obligation of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) No guarantee shall be issued by the Administration unless the Administration determines that there exists a reasonable expectation that the small business concern in behalf of which the guarantee is issued will perform the covenants and conditions of the qualified contract.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Uniform annual fees; processing fees; time and condition for payment; periodic review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administration shall fix a uniform annual fee for any guarantee issued under this section which shall be payable at such time and under such conditions as may be prescribed by the Administrator. The fee shall be set at an amount which the Administration deems reasonable and necessary and shall be subject to periodic review in order that the lowest fee that experience under the program shows to be justified will be placed into effect. In no case shall such amount be less than 1 per centum or more than 3&#189; per centum per annum of the minimum annual guaranteed rental payable under any qualified contract guaranteed under this section. The Administration may also fix such uniform fees for the processing of applications for guarantees under this section as the Administrator determines are reasonable and necessary to pay the administrative expenses that are incurred in connection therewith.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Requirements of Administration; escrow; default; discretionary provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In connection with the guarantee of rentals under any qualified contract pursuant to authority conferred by this section, the Administrator may require, in order to minimize the financial risk assumed under such guarantee&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) that the lessee pay an amount, not to exceed one-fourth of the average annual payments for which a guarantee is issued under this section, which shall be held in escrow and shall be available (A) to meet rental charges accruing in any month for which the lessee is in default, or (B) if no default occurs during the term of the qualified contract, for application (with accrued interest) toward final payments of rental charges under the qualified contract;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) that upon occurrence of a default under the qualified contract, the lessor shall, as a condition precedent to enforcing any claim under the qualified contract guarantee, utilize the entire period, for which there are funds available in escrow for payment of rentals, in reasonable diligent efforts to eliminate or minimize losses, by releasing the property covered by the qualified contract to another qualified lessee, and no claim shall be made or paid under the guarantee until such effort has been made and such escrow funds have been exhausted;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) that any guarantor of the qualified contract will become a successor of the lessor for the purpose of collecting from a lessee in default rentals which are in arrears and with respect to which the lessor has received payment under a guarantee made pursuant to this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) such other provisions, not inconsistent with the purposes of this section as the Administrator may in his discretion require.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Assignment of guarantee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any guarantee issued under this section may be assigned with the permission of the Administration by the person to whom the payments under qualified contracts are due.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Application of section 693 of this title</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Section 693 of this title shall apply to the administration of this section.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Procedure</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In making a prepayment under paragraph (1)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the borrower (in the case of a loan under section 697 of this title) or the issuer (in the case of a small business investment company) shall pay to the Federal Financing Bank an amount that is equal to the sum of the unpaid principal balance due on the debenture as of the date of the prepayment (plus accrued interest at the coupon rate on the debenture) and the amount of the repurchase premium described in subparagraph (B); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the Administration shall pay to the Federal Financing Bank the difference between the repurchase premium paid by the borrower under this subsection and the repurchase premium that the Federal Financing Bank would otherwise have received.</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of subparagraph (A)(i), the repurchase premium is the amount equal to the product of&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">The percentage rates described in clause (ii) shall be increased or decreased by the <!-- PDFPage:1151 -->Administration by a factor not to exceed one-third, if the same factor is applied in each case and if the Administration determines that an adjustment is necessary, based on the number of borrowers having given notice of their intent to participate, in order to make the program (including the amounts appropriated for this purpose under Public Law 103&ndash;317) result in no substantial net gain or loss of revenue to the Federal Financing Bank or to the Administration. Amounts collected in excess of the amount necessary to ensure revenue neutrality shall be refunded to the borrowers.</p>

Each preliminary notice shall specify the range and dollar amount of repurchase premiums which could be required of that borrower in order to participate in the program. In carrying out this program, the Administration shall provide a period of not less than 45 days following the receipt of such notice by the borrower during which the borrower must notify the Administration of the borrower's intent to participate in the program.
