<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Thirtieth day after filing or such earlier date as determined by Director; consolidation of subsequent statement with earlier recording</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as hereinafter provided, the effective date of a statement of record, or any amendment thereto, shall be the thirtieth day after the filing thereof or such earlier date as the Director may determine, having due regard to the public interest and the protection of purchasers. If any amendment to any such statement is filed prior to the effective date of the statement, the statement shall be deemed to have been filed when such amendment was filed; except that such an amendment filed with the consent of the Director, or filed pursuant to an order of the Director, shall be treated as being filed as of the date of the filing of the statement of record. When a developer records additional lands to be offered for disposition, he may consolidate the subsequent statement of record with any earlier recording offering subdivided land for disposition under the same promotional plan. At the time of consolidation the developer shall include in the consolidated statement of record any material changes in the information contained in the earlier statement.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Incomplete or inaccurate statements of record</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If it appears to the Director that a statement of record, or any amendment thereto, is on its face incomplete or inaccurate in any material respect, the Director shall so advise the developer within a reasonable time after the filing of the statement or the amendment, but prior to the date the statement or amendment would otherwise be effective. Such notification shall serve to suspend the effective date of the statement or the amendment until thirty days after the developer files such additional information as the Director shall require. Any developer, upon receipt of such notice, may request a hearing, and such hearing shall be held within twenty days of receipt of such request by the Director.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Amendment of statement of record</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If, at any time subsequent to the effective date of a statement of record, a change shall occur affecting any material fact required to be contained in the statement, the developer shall promptly file an amendment thereto. Upon receipt of any such amendment, the Director may, if he determines such action to be necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of purchasers, suspend the statement of record until the amendment becomes effective.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Suspension of statement of record containing untrue statement or omission to state material fact; notice and hearing; termination of order of suspension</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If it appears to the Director at any time that a statement of record, which is in effect, includes any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, the Director may, after notice, and after opportunity for hearing (at a time fixed by the Director) within fifteen days after such notice, issue an order suspending the statement of record. When such statement has been amended in accordance with such order, the Director shall so declare and thereupon the order shall cease to be effective.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Examination to determine issuance of order; access to records; order suspending statement of record upon failure to cooperate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Director is hereby empowered to make an examination in any case to determine whether an order should issue under subsection (d). In making such examination, the Director or anyone designated by him shall have access to and may demand the production of any books and papers of, and may administer oaths and affirmations to and examine, the developer, any agents or any other person, in respect of any matter relevant to the examination. If the developer or any agents shall fail to cooperate, or shall obstruct or refuse to permit the making of an examination, such conduct shall be proper ground for the issuance of an order suspending the statement of record.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Service of notices</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any notice required under this section shall be sent to or served on the developer or his authorized agent.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Criteria; request by State</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A State shall be certified if the Director determines&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) that, when taken as a whole, the laws and regulations of the State applicable to the sale or lease of lots not exempt under section 1702 of this title require the seller or lessor of such lots to disclose information which is at least substantially equivalent to the information required to be disclosed by section 1707 of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) that the State's administration of such laws and regulations provides, to the maximum extent practicable, that such information is accurate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In the case of any State which is not certified under paragraph (1), such State shall be certified if the Director determines&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) that, when taken as a whole, the laws and regulations of the State applicable to the sale or lease of lots not exempt under section 1702 of this title provide sufficient protection for purchasers and lessees with respect to the matters for which information is required to be disclosed by section 1707 of this title but which is not required to be disclosed by such State's laws and regulations; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) that the State's administration of such laws and regulations provides, to the maximum extent practicable, that (i) information required to be disclosed by such laws and regulations is accurate, and (ii) sufficient protection for purchasers and lessees is made available with respect to the matters for which information is not required to be disclosed.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any State requesting certification must agree to accept a property report covering land located in another certified State but offered for sale or lease in the State requesting certification if the property report has been approved by the other certified State. Such property report shall be the only property report required by the State with respect to the sale or lease of such land.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Filing of State disclosure materials and related documentation for purposes of Federal statement of record and property report requirements; acceptance by Director</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">After the Director has certified a State under subsection (a), the Director shall accept for filing under sections 1704 through 1707 of this title (and declare effective as the Federal statement of record and property report which shall be used in all States in which the lots are offered for sale or lease) disclosure materials found acceptable, and any related documentation required, by State authorities in connection with the sale or lease of lots located within the State. The Director may accept for such filing, and declare effective as the Federal statement of record and property report, such materials and documentation found acceptable by the State in connection with the sale or lease of lots located outside that State. Nothing in this subsection shall preclude the Director from exercising the authority conferred by subsections (d) and (e) of section 1706 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Notice to State upon failure to meet requirements and remedial action necessary for certification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a State fails to meet the standards for certification pursuant to subsection (a), the Director shall notify the State in writing of the changes in State law, regulation, or administration that are needed in order to obtain certification.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Periodic review of certified States&apos; laws, regulations, and administration; withdrawal of certification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Director shall periodically review the laws and regulations, and the administration <!-- PDFPage:1676 -->thereof, of States certified under subsection (a), and may withdraw such certification upon a determination that such laws, regulations, and the administration thereof, taken as a whole, no longer meet the requirements of subsection (a).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) State and local governmental authorities affected; cooperation with State authorities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this chapter may be construed to prevent or limit the authority of any State or local government to enact and enforce with regard to the sale of land any law, ordinance, or code not in conflict with this chapter. In administering this chapter, the Director shall cooperate with State authorities charged with the responsibility of regulating the sale or lease of lots which are subject to this chapter.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Any person, aggrieved by an order or determination of the Director issued after a hearing, may obtain a review of such order or determination in the court of appeals of the United States, within any circuit wherein such person resides or has his principal place of business, or in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, by filing in such court, within sixty days after the entry of such order or determination, a written petition praying that the order or determination of the Director be modified or be set aside in whole or in part. A copy of such petition shall be forthwith transmitted by the clerk of the court to the Director, and thereupon the Director shall file in the court the record upon which the order or determination complained of was entered, as provided in section 2112 of title 28. No objection to an order or determination of the Director shall be considered by the court unless such objection shall have been urged before the Director. The finding of the Director as to the facts, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive. If either party shall apply to the court for leave to adduce additional evidence, and shall show to the satisfaction of the court that such additional evidence is material and that there were reasonable grounds for failure to adduce such evidence in the hearing before the Director, the court may order such additional evidence to be taken before the Director and to be adduced upon a hearing in such manner and upon such terms and conditions as to the court may seem proper. The Director may modify his findings as to the facts by reason of the additional evidence so taken, and shall file such modified or new findings, which, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive, and his recommendation, if any, for the modification or setting aside of the original order. Upon the filing of such petition, the jurisdiction of the court shall be exclusive and its judgment and decree, affirming, modifying, or setting aside, in whole or in part, any order of the Director, shall be final, subject to review by the Supreme Court of the United States upon certiorari or certification as provided in section 1254 of title 28.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Investigations; publication of information concerning violations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Director may, in his discretion, make such investigations as he deems necessary to determine whether any person has violated or is about to violate any provision of this chapter or any rule or regulation prescribed pursuant thereto, and may require or permit any person to file with him a statement in writing, under oath or otherwise as the Director shall determine, as to all the facts and circumstances concerning the matter to be investigated. The Director is authorized, in his discretion, to publish information concerning any such violations, and to investigate any facts, conditions, practices, or matters which he may deem necessary or proper to aid in the enforcement of the provisions of this chapter, in the prescribing of rules and regulations thereunder, or in securing information to serve as a basis for recommending further legislation concerning the matters to which this chapter relates.</p>

And such court may issue an order requiring such person to appear before the Director or any officer designated by the Director, there to produce records, if so ordered, or to give testimony touching the matter under investigation or in question; and any failure to obey such order of the court may be punished by such court as a contempt thereof. All process in any such case may be served in the judicial district whereof such person is an inhabitant or wherever he may be found.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1717a. Civil money penalties</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Whenever any person knowingly and materially violates any of the provisions of this chapter or any rule, regulation, or order issued under this chapter, the Director may impose a civil money penalty on such person in accordance with the provisions of this section. The penalty shall be in addition to any other available civil remedy or any available criminal penalty, and may be imposed whether or not the Director imposes other administrative sanctions.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Amount of penalty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The amount of the penalty, as determined by the Director, may not exceed $1,000 for each violation, except that the maximum penalty for all violations by a particular person during any 1-year period shall not exceed $1,000,000. Each violation of this chapter, or any rule, regulation, or order issued under this chapter, shall constitute a separate violation with respect to each sale or lease or offer to sell or lease. In the case of a continuing violation, as determined by the Director, each day shall constitute a separate violation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Agency procedures</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Establishment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Director shall establish standards and procedures governing the imposition of civil money penalties under subsection (a). The standards and procedures&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) shall provide for the imposition of a penalty only after a person has been given an opportunity for a hearing on the record; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) may provide for review by the Director of any determination or order, or interlocutory ruling, arising from a hearing.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Final orders</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If no hearing is requested within 15 days of receipt of the notice of opportunity for hearing, the imposition of the penalty shall constitute a final and unappealable determination. If the Director reviews the determination or order, the Director may affirm, modify, or reverse that determination or order. If the Director does not review the determination or order within 90 days of the issuance of the determination or order, the determination or order shall be final.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Factors in determining amount of penalty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In determining the amount of a penalty under subsection (a), consideration shall be given to such factors as the gravity of the offense, any history of prior offenses (including offenses occurring before December 15, 1989), ability to pay the penalty, injury to the public, benefits received, deterrence of future violations, and such other factors as the Director may determine in regulations to be appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Reviewability of imposition of penalty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary's&#160;<sup><a href="#1717a_1_target" name="1717a_1">1</a></sup> determination or order imposing a penalty under subsection (a) shall not be subject to review, except as provided in subsection (c).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Judicial review of agency determination</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">After exhausting all administrative remedies established by the Director under subsection (b)(1), a person aggrieved by a final order of the Director assessing a penalty under this section may seek judicial review pursuant to section 1710 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Order to pay penalty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in any such review, the court shall have the power to order payment of the penalty imposed by the Director.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Action to collect penalty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If any person fails to comply with the determination or order of the Director imposing a civil money penalty under subsection (a), after the determination or order is no longer subject to review as provided by subsections (b) and (c), the Director may request the Attorney General of the United States to bring an action in any appropriate United States district court to obtain a monetary judgment against the person and such other relief as may be available. The monetary judgment may, in the discretion of the court, include any attorneys fees and other expenses incurred by the United States in connection with the action. In an action under this subsection, the validity and appropriateness of the Secretary's&#160;<sup><a href="#1717a_1_target" name="1717a_1">1</a></sup> determination or order imposing the penalty shall not be subject to review.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1681 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Settlement by Director</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Director may compromise, modify, or remit any civil money penalty which may be, or has been, imposed under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) &quot;Knowingly&quot; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The term &quot;knowingly&quot; means having actual knowledge of or acting with deliberate ignorance of or reckless disregard for the prohibitions under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Director shall issue such regulations as the Director deems appropriate to implement this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Use of penalties for administration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Civil money penalties collected under this section shall be paid to the Director and, upon approval in an appropriation Act, may be used by the Director to cover all or part of the cost of rendering services under this chapter.</p>
