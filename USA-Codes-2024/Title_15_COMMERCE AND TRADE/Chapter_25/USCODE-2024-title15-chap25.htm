Each such standard, regulation, or amendment thereto, shall become effective twelve months from the date on which such standard, regulation, or amendment is pro<!-- PDFPage:1345 -->mulgated, unless the Commission finds for good cause shown that an earlier or later effective date is in the public interest and publishes the reason for such finding. Each such standard or regulation or amendment thereto shall exempt fabrics related materials, or products in inventory or with the trade as of the date on which the standard, regulation, or amendment thereto, becomes effective except that, if the Commission finds that any such fabric, related material, or product is so highly flammable as to be dangerous when used by consumers for the purpose for which it is intended, it may under such conditions as the Commission may prescribe, withdraw, or limit the exemption for such fabric, related material, or product.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Collection of information by Commission; confidential status of trade secrets and related information; disclosure of confidential information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission may obtain from any person by regulation or subpena issued pursuant thereto such information in the form of testimony, books, records, or other writings as is pertinent to the findings or determinations which it is required or authorized to make pursuant to this chapter. All information reported to or otherwise obtained by the Commission or its representative pursuant to this subsection which information contains or relates to a trade secret or other matter referred to in section 1905 of title 18, shall be considered confidential for the purpose of that section, except that such information may be disclosed to other officers or employees concerned with carrying out this chapter or when relevant in any proceeding under this chapter. Nothing in this section shall authorize the withholding of information by the Commission or any officer or employee under its control, from the duly authorized committees of the Congress.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Applicability of section 553 of title 5; oral presentation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Standards, regulations, and amendments to standards and regulations under this section shall be made in accordance with section 553 of title 5, except that interested persons shall be given an opportunity for the oral presentation of data, views, or arguments in addition to an opportunity to make written submissions. A transcript shall be kept of any oral presentation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Judicial review; additional information before Commission; applicability of sections 701 to 706 of title 5; finality of judgment; survival of action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any person who will be adversely affected by any such standard or regulation or amendment thereto when it is effective may at any time prior to the sixtieth day after such standard or regulation or amendment thereto is issued file a petition with the United States court of appeals for the circuit wherein such person resides or has his principal place of business, for a judicial review thereof. A copy of the petition shall be forthwith transmitted by the clerk of the court to the Commission or other officer designated by him&#160;<sup><a href="#1193_1_target" name="1193_1">1</a></sup> for that purpose. The Commission thereupon shall file in the court the record of the proceedings on which the Commission based the standard or regulation, as provided in section 2112 of title 28.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the petitioner applies to the court for leave to adduce additional evidence, and shows to the satisfaction of the court that such additional evidence is material and that there were reasonable grounds for the failure to adduce such evidence in the proceeding before the Commission, the court may order such additional evidence (and evidence in rebuttal thereof) to be taken before the Commission, and to be adduced upon the hearing, in such manner and upon such terms and conditions as to the court may seem proper. The Commission may modify its findings, or make new findings, by reason of the additional evidence so taken, and it shall file such modified or new findings, and its recommendations, if any, for the modification or setting aside of its original standard or regulation or amendment thereto, with the return of such additional evidence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Upon the filing of the petition referred to in paragraph (1) of this subsection, the court shall have jurisdiction to review the standard or regulation in accordance with chapter 7 of title 5 and to grant appropriate relief as provided in such chapter. The standard or regulation shall not be affirmed unless the findings required by the first sentence of subsection (b) are supported by substantial evidence on the record taken as a whole. For purposes of this paragraph, the term &quot;record&quot; means the standard or regulation, any notice published with respect to the promulgation of such standard or regulation, the transcript required by subsection (d) of any oral presentation, any written submission of interested parties, and any other information which the Commission considers relevant to such standard or regulation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The judgment of the court affirming or setting aside, in whole or in part, any such standard or regulation of the Commission shall be final, subject to review by the Supreme Court of the United States upon certiorari or certification as provided in section 1254 of title 28.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The remedies provided for in this subsection shall be in addition to and not in substitution for any other remedies provided by law.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">A certified copy of the transcript of the record and proceedings under subsection (e) shall be furnished by the Commission to any interested party at his request, and payment of the costs thereof, and shall be admissible in any criminal, exclusion of imports, or other proceeding arising under or in respect of this chapter, irrespective of whether proceedings with respect to the standard or regulation or amendment thereto have previously been initiated or become final under subsection (e).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Promulgation of regulation; commencement of proceeding; publication of prescribed notice of proposed rulemaking</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A proceeding for the promulgation of a regulation under this section for a fabric, related material, or product may be commenced by a notice of proposed rulemaking or by the publication in the Federal Register of an advance notice of proposed rulemaking which shall&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) include information with respect to any existing standard known to the Commission which may be relevant to the proceedings, together with a summary of the reasons why the Commission believes preliminarily that such standard does not eliminate or adequately reduce the risk of injury identified in paragraph (1);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) invite interested persons to submit to the Commission, within such period as the Commission shall specify in the notice (which period shall not be less than 30 days or more than 60 days after the date of publication of the notice), comments with respect to the risk of injury identified by the Commission, the regulatory alternatives being considered, and other possible alternatives for addressing the risk;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">The Commission shall transmit such notice within 10 calendar days to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Voluntary standard; publication as proposed regulation; prerequisites for reliance by Commission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If the Commission determines that any standard submitted to it in response to an invitation in a notice published under subsection (g)(5) if promulgated (in whole, in part, or in combination with any other standard submitted to the Commission or any part of such a standard) as a regulation, would eliminate or adequately reduce the risk of injury identified in the notice provided under subsection (g)(1), the Commission may publish such standard, in whole, in part, or in such combination and with nonmaterial modifications, as a proposed regulation under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the Commission determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) compliance with any standard submitted to it in response to an invitation in a notice published under subsection (g)(6) is likely to result in the elimination or adequate reduction of the risk of injury identified in the notice, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) it is likely that there will be substantial compliance with such standard,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the Commission shall terminate any proceeding to promulgate a regulation respecting such risk of injury and shall publish in the Federal Register a notice which includes the determination of the Commission and which notifies the public that the Commission will rely on the voluntary standard to eliminate or reduce the risk of injury, except that the Commission shall terminate any such proceeding and rely on a voluntary standard only if such voluntary standard is in existence. For purposes of this section, a voluntary standard shall be considered to be in existence when it is finally approved by the organization or other person which developed such standard, irrespective of the effective date of the standard. Before relying upon any voluntary standard, the Commission shall afford interested persons (including manufacturers, consumers, and consumer organizations) a reasonable opportunity to submit written comments regarding such standard. The Commission shall consider such comments in making any determination regarding reliance on the involved voluntary standard under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Commission shall devise procedures to monitor compliance with any voluntary standards&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) upon which the Commission has relied under paragraph (2) of this subsection;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) which were developed with the participation of the Commission; or</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Publication of proposed rule by Commission; preliminary regulatory analysis; contents; transmission of notice by Commission to Committees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No regulation may be proposed by the Commission under this section unless the Commission publishes in the Federal Register the text of the proposed rule, including any alternatives, which the Commission proposes to promulgate, together with a preliminary regulatory analysis containing&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a preliminary description of the potential benefits and potential costs of the proposed regulation, including any benefits or costs that cannot be quantified in monetary terms, and an identification of those likely to receive the benefits and bear the costs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a discussion of the reasons any standard or portion of a standard submitted to the Commission under subsection (g)(5) was not published by the Commission as the proposed regulation or part of the proposed regulation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) a discussion of the reasons for the Commission's preliminary determination that efforts proposed under subsection (g)(6) and assisted by the Commission as required by section 2054(a)(3) of this title would not, within a reasonable period of time, be likely to result in the development of a voluntary standard that would eliminate or adequately reduce the risk of injury identified in the notice provided under subsection (g)(1); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) a description of any reasonable alternatives to the proposed regulation, together <!-- PDFPage:1347 -->with a summary description of their potential costs and benefits, and a brief explanation of why such alternatives should not be published as a proposed regulation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Commission shall transmit such notice within 10 calendar days to the appropriate Congressional committees. Nothing in this subsection shall preclude any person from submitting an existing standard or portion of a standard as a proposed regulation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) A description of any alternatives to the final regulation which were considered by the Commission, together with a summary description of their potential benefits and costs and a brief explanation of the reasons why these alternatives were not chosen.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) A summary of any significant issues raised by the comments submitted during the public comment period in response to the preliminary regulatory analysis, and a summary of the assessment by the Commission of such issues.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Commission shall publish its final regulatory analysis with the regulation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission shall not promulgate a regulation under this section unless it finds (and includes such finding in the regulation)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) in the case of a regulation which relates to a risk of injury with respect to which persons who would be subject to such regulation have adopted and implemented a voluntary standard, that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) compliance with such voluntary standard is not likely to result in the elimination or adequate reduction of such risk of injury; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) it is unlikely that there will be substantial compliance with such voluntary standard;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) that the benefits expected from the regulation bear a reasonable relationship to its costs; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) that the regulation imposes the least burdensome requirement which prevents or adequately reduces the risk of injury for which the regulation is being promulgated.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Any regulatory analysis prepared under subsection (i) or paragraph (1) shall not be subject to independent judicial review, except that when an action for judicial review of a regulation is instituted, the contents of any such regulatory analysis shall constitute part of the whole rulemaking record of agency action in connection with such review.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The provisions of subparagraph (A) shall not be construed to alter the substantive or procedural standards otherwise applicable to judicial review of any action by the Commission.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Petition to initiate rulemaking</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall grant, in whole or in part, or deny any petition under section 553(e) of title 5 requesting the Commission to initiate a rulemaking, within a reasonable time after the date on which such petition is filed. The Commission shall state the reasons for granting or denying such petition. The Commission may not deny any such petition on the basis of a voluntary standard unless the voluntary standard is in existence at the time of the denial of the petition, the Commission has determined that the voluntary standard is likely to result in the elimination or adequate reduction of the risk of injury identified in the petition, and it is likely that there will be substantial compliance with the standard.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Enforcement under Federal Trade Commission Act provisions; civil action to enforce standard or regulation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, sections 1192, 1194, 1195, and 1197(b) of this title shall be enforced by the Commission under rules, regulations and procedures provided for in the Federal Trade Commission Act [15 U.S.C. 41 et seq.]. In the case of an attorney general of a State alleging a violation of a standard or regulation under section 1193 of this title that affects or may affect such State or its residents, such attorney general may bring a civil action for an injunction to enforce the requirement of such standard or regulation. The procedural requirements of section 2073 of this title shall apply to any such action.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Application of Federal Trade Commission Act provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission is authorized and directed to prevent any person from violating the provisions of section 1192 of this title in the same manner, by the same means and with the same jurisdiction, powers and duties as though all applicable terms and provisions of the Federal Trade Commission Act [15 U.S.C. 41 et seq.] were incorporated into and made a part of this chapter; and any such person violating any provision of section 1192 of this title shall be subject to the penalties and entitled to the privileges and immunities provided in said Federal Trade Commission Act as though the applicable terms and provisions of the said Federal Trade Commission Act were incorporated into and made a part of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Rules and regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission is authorized and directed to prescribe such rules and regulations, including provisions for maintenance of records relating to fabrics, related materials, and products, as may be necessary and proper for administration and enforcement of this chapter. The violation of such rules and regulations shall be unlawful and shall be an unfair method of competition and an unfair and deceptive act or practice, in commerce, under the Federal Trade Commission Act [15 U.S.C. 41 et seq.].</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Inspection and analysis of products; cooperation with other governmental entities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission is authorized to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) cause inspections, analyses, tests, and examinations to be made of any product, fabric or related material which it has reason to believe falls within the prohibitions of this chapter; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) cooperate on matters related to the purposes of this chapter with any department or agency of the Government; with any State or territory or with the District of Columbia or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico; or with any department, agency, or political subdivision thereof; or with any person.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Penalties</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any person who knowingly violates a regulation or standard under section 1193 of this title shall be subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $100,000 for each such violation, except that the maximum civil penalty shall not exceed $15,000,000 for any related series of violations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In determining the amount of any penalty to be sought upon commencing an action seeking to assess a penalty for a violation of a regulation or standard under section 1193 of this <!-- PDFPage:1349 -->title, the Commission shall consider the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violations, the severity of the risk of injury, the occurrence or absence of injury, the appropriateness of such penalty in relation to the size of the business of the person charged, and such other factors as appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any civil penalty under this subsection may be compromised by the Commission.

<!-- field-end:head -->

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Temporary injunction; venue</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever the Commission has reason to believe that any person is violating or is about to violate section 1192 of this title, or a rule or regulation prescribed under section 1194(c) of this title, and that it would be in the public interest to enjoin such violation until complaint under the Federal Trade Commission Act [15 U.S.C. 41 et seq.] is issued and dismissed by the Commission or until order to cease and desist made thereon by the Commission has become final within the meaning of the Federal Trade Commission Act or is set aside by the court on review, the Commission may bring suit in the district court of the United States for the district in which such person resides or transacts business, or, if such person resides or transacts business in Guam or the Virgin Islands, then in the District Court of Guam or in the District Court of the Virgin Islands (as the case may be), to enjoin such violation and upon proper showing a temporary injunction or restraining order shall be granted without bond.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Process of libel for seizure and confiscation; manner of procedure; consolidation of trials</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever the Commission has reason to believe that any product has been manufactured or introduced into commerce or any fabric or related material has been introduced in commerce in violation of section 1192 of this title, it may institute proceedings by process of libel for the seizure and confiscation of such product, fabric, or related material in any district court of the United States within the jurisdiction of which such product, fabric, or related material is found. Proceedings in cases instituted under the authority of this section shall conform as nearly as may be to proceedings in rem in admiralty, except that on demand of either party and in the discretion of the court, any issue of fact shall be tried by jury. Whenever such proceedings involving identical products, fabrics, or related materials are pending in two or more jurisdictions, they may be consolidated for trial by order of any such court upon application seasonably made by any party in interest upon notice to all other parties in interest. Any court granting an order of consolidation shall cause prompt notification thereof to be given to other courts having jurisdiction in the cases covered thereby and the clerks of such other courts shall transmit all pertinent records and papers to the court designated for the trial of such consolidated proceedings.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Application by defendant for representative sample of seized materials</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any such action the court, upon application seasonably made before trial, shall by order allow any party in interest, his attorney or agent, to obtain a representative sample of the product, fabric, or related material seized.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Disposal of condemned materials</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If such products, fabrics, or related materials are condemned by the court they shall be disposed of by destruction, by delivery to the owner or claimant thereof upon payment of court costs and fees and storage and other proper expenses and upon execution of good and sufficient bond to the effect that such products, fabrics, or related materials will not be disposed of until properly and adequately treated or processed so as to render them lawful for introduction into commerce, or by sale upon execution of good and sufficient bond to the effect that such products, fabrics, or related materials will not be disposed of until properly and adequately treated or processed so as to render them lawful for introduction into commerce. If such products, fabrics, or related materials are disposed of by sale the proceeds, less costs and charges, shall be paid into the Treasury of the United States.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) State standards or regulations which afford a higher degree of protection</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Federal Government and the government of any State or political subdivision of a State may establish and continue in effect a flammability standard or other regulation applicable to a fabric, related material, or product for its own use which standard or other regulation is designed to protect against a risk of occurrence of fire with respect to which a flammability standard or other regulation is in effect under this chapter and which is not identical to such standard or other regulation if the Federal, State, or political subdivision standard or other regulation provides a higher degree of protection from such risk of occurrence of fire than the standard or other regulation in effect under this chapter.</p>
