<h4 class="note-head">Ex. Ord. No. 14036. Promoting Competition in the American Economy</h4>
<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 14036, July 9, 2021, 86 F.R. 36987, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to promote the interests of American workers, businesses, and consumers, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <i>Policy</i>. A fair, open, and competitive marketplace has long been a cornerstone of the American economy, while excessive market concentration threatens basic economic liberties, democratic accountability, and the welfare of workers, farmers, small businesses, startups, and consumers.</p>
<p class="note-body">The American promise of a broad and sustained prosperity depends on an open and competitive economy. For workers, a competitive marketplace creates more high-quality jobs and the economic freedom to switch jobs or negotiate a higher wage. For small businesses and farmers, it creates more choices among suppliers and major buyers, leading to more take-home income, which they can reinvest in their enterprises. For entrepreneurs, it provides space to experiment, innovate, and pursue the new ideas that have for centuries powered the American economy and improved our quality of life. And for consumers, it means more choices, better service, and lower prices.</p>
<p class="note-body">Robust competition is critical to preserving America's role as the world's leading economy.</p>
<p class="note-body">Yet over the last several decades, as industries have consolidated, competition has weakened in too many markets, denying Americans the benefits of an open economy and widening racial, income, and wealth inequality. Federal Government inaction has contributed to these problems, with workers, farmers, small businesses, and consumers paying the price.</p>
<p class="note-body">Consolidation has increased the power of corporate employers, making it harder for workers to bargain for higher wages and better work conditions. Powerful companies require workers to sign non-compete agreements that restrict their ability to change jobs. And, while many occupational licenses are critical to increasing wages for workers and especially workers of color, some overly restrictive occupational licensing requirements can impede workers&apos; ability to find jobs and to move between States.</p>
<p class="note-body">Consolidation in the agricultural industry is making it too hard for small family farms to survive. Farmers are squeezed between concentrated market power in the agricultural input industries&mdash;seed, fertilizer, feed, and equipment suppliers&mdash;and concentrated market power in the channels for selling agricultural products. As a result, farmers&apos; share of the value of their agricultural products has decreased, and poultry farmers, hog farmers, cattle ranchers, and other agricultural workers struggle to retain autonomy and to make sustainable returns.</p>
<p class="note-body">The American information technology sector has long been an engine of innovation and growth, but today a small number of dominant internet platforms use their power to exclude market entrants, to extract monopoly profits, and to gather intimate personal information that they can exploit for their own advantage. Too many small businesses across the economy depend on those platforms and a few online marketplaces for their survival. And too many local newspapers have shuttered or downsized, in part due to the internet platforms&apos; dominance in advertising markets.</p>
<p class="note-body">Americans are paying too much for prescription drugs and healthcare services&mdash;far more than the prices paid in other countries. Hospital consolidation has left many areas, particularly rural communities, with inadequate or more expensive healthcare options. And too often, patent and other laws have been misused to inhibit or delay&mdash;for years and even decades&mdash;competition from generic drugs and biosimilars, denying Americans access to lower-cost drugs.</p>
<p class="note-body">In the telecommunications sector, Americans likewise pay too much for broadband, cable television, and other communications services, in part because of a lack of adequate competition. In the financial-services sector, consumers pay steep and often hidden fees because of industry consolidation. Similarly, the global container shipping industry has consolidated into a small number of dominant foreign-owned lines and alliances, which can disadvantage American exporters.</p>
<p class="note-body">The problem of economic consolidation now spans these sectors and many others, endangering our ability to rebuild and emerge from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID&ndash;19) pandemic with a vibrant, innovative, and growing economy. Meanwhile, the United States faces new challenges to its economic standing in the world, including unfair competitive pressures from foreign monopolies and firms that are state-owned or state-sponsored, or whose market power is directly supported by foreign governments.</p>
<p class="note-body">We must act now to reverse these dangerous trends, which constrain the growth and dynamism of our economy, impair the creation of high-quality jobs, and threaten America's economic standing in the world.</p>
<p class="note-body">This order affirms that it is the policy of my Administration to enforce the antitrust laws to combat the excessive concentration of industry, the abuses of market power, and the harmful effects of monopoly and monopsony&mdash;especially as these issues arise in labor markets, agricultural markets, Internet platform industries, healthcare markets (including insurance, hospital, and prescription drug markets), repair markets, and United States markets directly affected by foreign cartel activity.</p>
<p class="note-body">It is also the policy of my Administration to enforce the antitrust laws to meet the challenges posed by new industries and technologies, including the rise of the dominant Internet platforms, especially as they stem from serial mergers, the acquisition of nascent competitors, the aggregation of data, unfair competition in attention markets, the surveillance of users, and the presence of network effects.</p>
<p class="note-body">Whereas decades of industry consolidation have often led to excessive market concentration, this order reaffirms that the United States retains the authority to challenge transactions whose previous consummation was in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act (26 Stat. 209, 15 U.S.C. 1 <i>et seq</i>.) (Sherman Act), the Clayton Antitrust Act (Public Law 63&ndash;212, 38 Stat. 730, 15 U.S.C. 12 <i>et seq</i>.) (Clayton Act), or other laws. <i>See</i> 15 U.S.C. 18; <i>Standard Oil Co. v. United States</i>, 221 U.S. 1 (1911).</p>
<p class="note-body">This order reasserts as United States policy that the answer to the rising power of foreign monopolies and cartels is not the tolerance of domestic monopolization, but rather the promotion of competition and innovation by firms small and large, at home and worldwide.</p>
<p class="note-body">It is also the policy of my Administration to support aggressive legislative reforms that would lower prescription drug prices, including by allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices, by imposing inflation caps, and through other related reforms. It is further the policy of my Administration to support the enactment of a public health insurance option.</p>
<p class="note-body">My Administration further reaffirms the policy stated in Executive Order 13725 of April 15, 2016 (Steps to Increase Competition and Better Inform Consumers and Workers to Support Continued Growth of the American Economy) [5 U.S.C. 601 note], and the Federal Government's commitment to the principles that led to the passage of the Sherman Act, the Clayton Act, the Packers and Stockyards Act, 1921 (Public Law 67&ndash;51, 42 Stat. 159, 7 U.S.C. 181 <i>et seq</i>.) (Packers and Stockyards Act), the Celler-Kefauver Antimerger Act (Public Law 81&ndash;899, 64 Stat. 1125), the Bank Merger Act (Public Law 86&ndash;463, 74 Stat. 129, 12 U.S.C. 1828), and the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (Public Law 104&ndash;104, 110 Stat. 56), among others.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec.</cap-smallcap> 2. <i>The Statutory Basis of a Whole-of-Government Competition Policy</i>. (a) The antitrust laws, including the Sherman Act, the Clayton Act, and the Federal Trade Commission Act (Public Law 63&ndash;203, 38 Stat. 717, 15 U.S.C. 41 <i>et seq</i>.), are a first line of defense against the monopolization of the American economy.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:9 --><p class="note-body">(b) The antitrust laws reflect an underlying policy favoring competition that transcends those particular enactments. As the Supreme Court has stated, for instance, the Sherman Act &quot;rests on the premise that the unrestrained interaction of competitive forces will yield the best allocation of our economic resources, the lowest prices, the highest quality and the greatest material progress, while at the same time providing an environment conducive to the preservation of our democratic political and social institutions.&quot; <i>Northern Pac. Ry. Co. v. United States</i>, 356 U.S. 1, 4 (1958).</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Consistent with these broader policies, and in addition to the traditional antitrust laws, the Congress has also enacted industry-specific fair competition and anti-monopolization laws that often provide additional protections. Such enactments include the Packers and Stockyards Act, the Federal Alcohol Administration Act (Public Law 74&ndash;401, 49 Stat. 977, 27 U.S.C. 201 <i>et seq</i>.), the Bank Merger Act, the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (Public Law 98&ndash;417, 98 Stat. 1585), the Shipping Act of 1984 (Public Law 98&ndash;237, 98 Stat. 67, 46 U.S.C. 40101 <i>et seq</i>.) (Shipping Act), the ICC Termination Act of 1995 (Public Law 104&ndash;88, 109 Stat. 803), the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the Fairness to Contact Lens Consumers Act (Public Law 108&ndash;164, 117 Stat. 2024, 15 U.S.C. 7601 <i>et seq</i>.), and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Public Law 111&ndash;203, 124 Stat. 1376) (Dodd-Frank Act).</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) These statutes independently charge a number of executive departments and agencies (agencies) to protect conditions of fair competition in one or more ways, including by:</p>
<p class="note-body">(i) policing unfair, deceptive, and abusive business practices;</p>
<p class="note-body">(ii) resisting consolidation and promoting competition within industries through the independent oversight of mergers, acquisitions, and joint ventures;</p>
<p class="note-body">(iii) promulgating rules that promote competition, including the market entry of new competitors; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(iv) promoting market transparency through compelled disclosure of information.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) The agencies that administer such or similar authorities include the Department of the Treasury, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Transportation, the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Communications Commission, the Federal Maritime Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and the Surface Transportation Board.</p>
<p class="note-body">(f) Agencies can influence the conditions of competition through their exercise of regulatory authority or through the procurement process. <i>See</i> 41 U.S.C. 1705.</p>
<p class="note-body">(g) This order recognizes that a whole-of-government approach is necessary to address overconcentration, monopolization, and unfair competition in the American economy. Such an approach is supported by existing statutory mandates. Agencies can and should further the polices set forth in section 1 of this order by, among other things, adopting pro-competitive regulations and approaches to procurement and spending, and by rescinding regulations that create unnecessary barriers to entry that stifle competition.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec.</cap-smallcap> 3. <i>Agency Cooperation in Oversight, Investigation, and Remedies</i>. (a) The Congress frequently has created overlapping agency jurisdiction in the policing of anticompetitive conduct and the oversight of mergers. It is the policy of my Administration that, when agencies have overlapping jurisdiction, they should endeavor to cooperate fully in the exercise of their oversight authority, to benefit from the respective expertise of the agencies and to improve Government efficiency.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Where there is overlapping jurisdiction over particular cases, conduct, transactions, or industries, agencies are encouraged to coordinate their efforts, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, with respect to:</p>
<p class="note-body">(i) the investigation of conduct potentially harmful to competition;</p>
<p class="note-body">(ii) the oversight of proposed mergers, acquisitions, and joint ventures; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(iii) the design, execution, and oversight of remedies.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) The means of cooperation in cases of overlapping jurisdiction should include, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law:</p>
<p class="note-body">(i) sharing relevant information and industry data;</p>
<p class="note-body">(ii) in the case of major transactions, soliciting and giving significant consideration to the views of the Attorney General or the Chair of the FTC, as applicable; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(iii) cooperating with any concurrent Department of Justice or FTC oversight activities under the Sherman Act or Clayton Act.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) Nothing in subsections (a) through (c) of this section shall be construed to suggest that the statutory standard applied by an agency, or its independent assessment under that standard, should be displaced or substituted by the judgment of the Attorney General or the Chair of the FTC. When their views are solicited, the Attorney General and the Chair of the FTC are encouraged to provide a response to the agency in time for the agency to consider it in advance of any statutory deadline for agency action.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec.</cap-smallcap> 4. <i>The White House Competition Council</i>. (a) There is established a White House Competition Council (Council) within the Executive Office of the President.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The Council shall coordinate, promote, and advance Federal Government efforts to address overconcentration, monopolization, and unfair competition in or directly affecting the American economy, including efforts to:</p>
<p class="note-body">(i) implement the administrative actions identified in this order;</p>
<p class="note-body">(ii) develop procedures and best practices for agency cooperation and coordination on matters of overlapping jurisdiction, as described in section 3 of this order;</p>
<p class="note-body">(iii) identify and advance any additional administrative actions necessary to further the policies set forth in section 1 of this order; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(iv) identify any potential legislative changes necessary to further the policies set forth in section 1 of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) The Council shall work across agencies to provide a coordinated response to overconcentration, monopolization, and unfair competition in or directly affecting the American economy. The Council shall also work with each agency to ensure that agency operations are conducted in a manner that promotes fair competition, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) The Council shall not discuss any current or anticipated enforcement actions.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) The Council shall be led by the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy and Director of the National Economic Council, who shall serve as Chair of the Council.</p>
<p class="note-body">(f) In addition to the Chair, the Council shall consist of the following members:</p>
<p class="note-body">(i) the Secretary of the Treasury;</p>
<p class="note-body">(ii) the Secretary of Defense;</p>
<p class="note-body">(iii) the Attorney General;</p>
<p class="note-body">(iv) the Secretary of Agriculture;</p>
<p class="note-body">(v) the Secretary of Commerce;</p>
<p class="note-body">(vi) the Secretary of Labor;</p>
<p class="note-body">(vii) the Secretary of Health and Human Services;</p>
<p class="note-body">(viii) the Secretary of Transportation;</p>
<p class="note-body">(ix) the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(x) the heads of such other agencies and offices as the Chair may from time to time invite to participate.</p>
<p class="note-body">(g) The Chair shall invite the participation of the Chair of the FTC, the Chair of the Federal Communications Commission, the Chair of the Federal Maritime Commission, the Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and the Chair of the Surface Transportation Board, to the extent consistent with their respective statutory authorities and obligations.</p>
<p class="note-body">(h) Members of the Council shall designate, not later than 30 days after the date of this order [July 9, 2021], <!-- PDFPage:10 -->a senior official within their respective agency or office who shall coordinate with the Council and who shall be responsible for overseeing the agency's or office's efforts to address overconcentration, monopolization, and unfair competition. The Chair may coordinate subgroups consisting exclusively of Council members or their designees, as appropriate.</p>
<p class="note-body">(i) The Council shall meet on a semi-annual basis unless the Chair determines that a meeting is unnecessary.</p>
<p class="note-body">(j) Each agency shall bear its own expenses for participating in the Council.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec.</cap-smallcap> 5. <i>Further Agency Responsibilities</i>. (a) The heads of all agencies shall consider using their authorities to further the policies set forth in section 1 of this order, with particular attention to:</p>
<p class="note-body">(i) the influence of any of their respective regulations, particularly any licensing regulations, on concentration and competition in the industries under their jurisdiction; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(ii) the potential for their procurement or other spending to improve the competitiveness of small businesses and businesses with fair labor practices.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The Attorney General, the Chair of the FTC, and the heads of other agencies with authority to enforce the Clayton Act are encouraged to enforce the antitrust laws fairly and vigorously.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) To address the consolidation of industry in many markets across the economy, as described in section 1 of this order, the Attorney General and the Chair of the FTC are encouraged to review the horizontal and vertical merger guidelines and consider whether to revise those guidelines.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) To avoid the potential for anticompetitive extension of market power beyond the scope of granted patents, and to protect standard-setting processes from abuse, the Attorney General and the Secretary of Commerce are encouraged to consider whether to revise their position on the intersection of the intellectual property and antitrust laws, including by considering whether to revise the Policy Statement on Remedies for Standards-Essential Patents Subject to Voluntary F/RAND Commitments issued jointly by the Department of Justice, the United States Patent and Trademark Office, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology on December 19, 2019.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) To ensure Americans have choices among financial institutions and to guard against excessive market power, the Attorney General, in consultation with the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Chairperson of the Board of Directors of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Comptroller of the Currency, is encouraged to review current practices and adopt a plan, not later than 180 days after the date of this order, for the revitalization of merger oversight under the Bank Merger Act and the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (Public Law 84&ndash;511, 70 Stat. 133, 12 U.S.C. 1841 <i>et seq</i>.) that is in accordance with the factors enumerated in 12 U.S.C. 1828(c) and 1842(c).</p>
<p class="note-body">(f) To better protect workers from wage collusion, the Attorney General and the Chair of the FTC are encouraged to consider whether to revise the Antitrust Guidance for Human Resource Professionals of October 2016.</p>
<p class="note-body">(g) To address agreements that may unduly limit workers&apos; ability to change jobs, the Chair of the FTC is encouraged to consider working with the rest of the Commission to exercise the FTC's statutory rulemaking authority under the Federal Trade Commission Act to curtail the unfair use of non-compete clauses and other clauses or agreements that may unfairly limit worker mobility.</p>
<p class="note-body">(h) To address persistent and recurrent practices that inhibit competition, the Chair of the FTC, in the Chair's discretion, is also encouraged to consider working with the rest of the Commission to exercise the FTC's statutory rulemaking authority, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, in areas such as:</p>
<p class="note-body">(i) unfair data collection and surveillance practices that may damage competition, consumer autonomy, and consumer privacy;</p>
<p class="note-body">(ii) unfair anticompetitive restrictions on third-party repair or self-repair of items, such as the restrictions imposed by powerful manufacturers that prevent farmers from repairing their own equipment;</p>
<p class="note-body">(iii) unfair anticompetitive conduct or agreements in the prescription drug industries, such as agreements to delay the market entry of generic drugs or biosimilars;</p>
<p class="note-body">(iv) unfair competition in major Internet marketplaces;</p>
<p class="note-body">(v) unfair occupational licensing restrictions;</p>
<p class="note-body">(vi) unfair tying practices or exclusionary practices in the brokerage or listing of real estate; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(vii) any other unfair industry-specific practices that substantially inhibit competition.</p>
<p class="note-body">(i) The Secretary of Agriculture shall:</p>
<p class="note-body">(i) to address the unfair treatment of farmers and improve conditions of competition in the markets for their products, consider initiating a rulemaking or rulemakings under the Packers and Stockyards Act to strengthen the Department of Agriculture's regulations concerning unfair, unjustly discriminatory, or deceptive practices and undue or unreasonable preferences, advantages, prejudices, or disadvantages, with the purpose of furthering the vigorous implementation of the law established by the Congress in 1921 and fortified by amendments. In such rulemaking or rulemakings, the Secretary of Agriculture shall consider, among other things:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(A) providing clear rules that identify recurrent practices in the livestock, meat, and poultry industries that are unfair, unjustly discriminatory, or deceptive and therefore violate the Packers and Stockyards Act;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(B) reinforcing the long-standing Department of Agriculture interpretation that it is unnecessary under the Packers and Stockyards Act to demonstrate industry-wide harm to establish a violation of the Act and that the &quot;unfair, unjustly discriminatory, or deceptive&quot; treatment of one farmer, the giving to one farmer of an &quot;undue or unreasonable preference or advantage,&quot; or the subjection of one farmer to an &quot;undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage in any respect&quot; violates the Act;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(C) prohibiting unfair practices related to grower ranking systems&mdash;systems in which the poultry companies, contractors, or dealers exercise extraordinary control over numerous inputs that determine the amount farmers are paid and require farmers to assume the risk of factors outside their control, leaving them more economically vulnerable;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(D) updating the appropriate definitions or set of criteria, or application thereof, for undue or unreasonable preferences, advantages, prejudices, or disadvantages under the Packers and Stockyards Act; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(E) adopting, to the greatest extent possible and as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, appropriate anti-retaliation protections, so that farmers may assert their rights without fear of retribution;</p>
<p class="note-body">(ii) to ensure consumers have accurate, transparent labels that enable them to choose products made in the United States, consider initiating a rulemaking to define the conditions under which the labeling of meat products can bear voluntary statements indicating that the product is of United States origin, such as &quot;Product of USA&quot;;</p>
<p class="note-body">(iii) to ensure that farmers have greater opportunities to access markets and receive a fair return for their products, not later than 180 days after the date of this order, submit a report to the Chair of the White House Competition Council, with a plan to promote competition in the agricultural industries and to support value-added agriculture and alternative food distribution systems through such means as:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(A) the creation or expansion of useful information for farmers, such as model contracts, to lower transaction costs and help farmers negotiate fair deals;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(B) measures to encourage improvements in transparency and standards so that consumers may choose <!-- PDFPage:11 -->to purchase products that support fair treatment of farmers and agricultural workers and sustainable agricultural practices;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(C) measures to enhance price discovery, increase transparency, and improve the functioning of the cattle and other livestock markets;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(D) enhanced tools, including any new legislative authorities needed, to protect whistleblowers, monitor agricultural markets, and enforce relevant laws;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(E) any investments or other support that could bolster competition within highly concentrated agricultural markets; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(F) any other means that the Secretary of Agriculture deems appropriate;</p>
<p class="note-body">(iv) to improve farmers&apos; and smaller food processors&apos; access to retail markets, not later than 300 days after the date of this order, in consultation with the Chair of the FTC, submit a report to the Chair of the White House Competition Council, on the effect of retail concentration and retailers&apos; practices on the conditions of competition in the food industries, including any practices that may violate the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Robinson-Patman Act (Public Law 74&ndash;692, 49 Stat. 1526, 15 U.S.C. 13 <i>et seq</i>.), or other relevant laws, and on grants, loans, and other support that may enhance access to retail markets by local and regional food enterprises; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(v) to help ensure that the intellectual property system, while incentivizing innovation, does not also unnecessarily reduce competition in seed and other input markets beyond that reasonably contemplated by the Patent Act (<i>see</i> 35 U.S.C. 100 <i>et seq</i>. and 7 U.S.C. 2321 <i>et seq</i>.), in consultation with the Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and Director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office, submit a report to the Chair of the White House Competition Council, enumerating and describing any relevant concerns of the Department of Agriculture and strategies for addressing those concerns across intellectual property, antitrust, and other relevant laws.</p>
<p class="note-body">(j) To protect the vibrancy of the American markets for beer, wine, and spirits, and to improve market access for smaller, independent, and new operations, the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Attorney General and the Chair of the FTC, not later than 120 days after the date of this order, shall submit a report to the Chair of the White House Competition Council, assessing the current market structure and conditions of competition, including an assessment of any threats to competition and barriers to new entrants, including:</p>
<p class="note-body">(i) any unlawful trade practices in the beer, wine, and spirits markets, such as certain exclusionary, discriminatory, or anticompetitive distribution practices, that hinder smaller and independent businesses or new entrants from distributing their products;</p>
<p class="note-body">(ii) patterns of consolidation in production, distribution, or retail beer, wine, and spirits markets; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(iii) any unnecessary trade practice regulations of matters such as bottle sizes, permitting, or labeling that may unnecessarily inhibit competition by increasing costs without serving any public health, informational, or tax purpose.</p>
<p class="note-body">(k) To follow up on the foregoing assessment, the Secretary of the Treasury, through the Administrator of the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, shall, not later than 240 days after the date of this order, consider:</p>
<p class="note-body">(i) initiating a rulemaking to update the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau's trade practice regulations;</p>
<p class="note-body">(ii) rescinding or revising any regulations of the beer, wine, and spirits industries that may unnecessarily inhibit competition; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(iii) reducing any barriers that impede market access for smaller and independent brewers, winemakers, and distilleries.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;15c. Actions by State attorneys general</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Parens patriae; monetary relief; damages; prejudgment interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any attorney general of a State may bring a civil action in the name of such State, as parens patriae on behalf of natural persons residing in such State, in any district court of the United States having jurisdiction of the defendant, to secure monetary relief as provided in <!-- PDFPage:24 -->this section for injury sustained by such natural persons to their property by reason of any violation of sections 1 to 7 of this title. The court shall exclude from the amount of monetary relief awarded in such action any amount of monetary relief (A) which duplicates amounts which have been awarded for the same injury, or (B) which is properly allocable to (i) natural persons who have excluded their claims pursuant to subsection (b)(2) of this section, and (ii) any business entity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The court shall award the State as monetary relief threefold the total damage sustained as described in paragraph (1) of this subsection, and the cost of suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee. The court may award under this paragraph, pursuant to a motion by such State promptly made, simple interest on the total damage for the period beginning on the date of service of such State's pleading setting forth a claim under the antitrust laws and ending on the date of judgment, or for any shorter period therein, if the court finds that the award of such interest for such period is just in the circumstances. In determining whether an award of interest under this paragraph for any period is just in the circumstances, the court shall consider only&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) whether such State or the opposing party, or either party's representative, made motions or asserted claims or defenses so lacking in merit as to show that such party or representative acted intentionally for delay or otherwise acted in bad faith;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) whether, in the course of the action involved, such State or the opposing party, or either party's representative, violated any applicable rule, statute, or court order providing for sanctions for dilatory behavior or other wise providing for expeditious proceedings; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) whether such State or the opposing party, or either party's representative, engaged in conduct primarily for the purpose of delaying the litigation or increasing the cost thereof.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Notice; exclusion election; final judgment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In any action brought under subsection (a)(1) of this section, the State attorney general shall, at such times, in such manner, and with such content as the court may direct, cause notice thereof to be given by publication. If the court finds that notice given solely by publication would deny due process of law to any person or persons, the court may direct further notice to such person or persons according to the circumstances of the case.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any person on whose behalf an action is brought under subsection (a)(1) may elect to exclude from adjudication the portion of the State claim for monetary relief attributable to him by filing notice of such election with the court within such time as specified in the notice given pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The final judgment in an action under subsection (a)(1) shall be res judicata as to any claim under section 15 of this title by any person on behalf of whom such action was brought and who fails to give such notice within the period specified in the notice given pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Dismissal or compromise of action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An action under subsection (a)(1) shall not be dismissed or compromised without the approval of the court, and notice of any proposed dismissal or compromise shall be given in such manner as the court directs.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Attorneys&apos; fees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any action under subsection (a)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the amount of the plaintiffs&apos; attorney's fee, if any, shall be determined by the court; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the court may, in its discretion, award a reasonable attorney's fee to a prevailing defendant upon a finding that the State attorney general has acted in bad faith, vexatiously, wantonly, or for oppressive reasons.</p>

Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to impose any limitation on the application of collateral estoppel, except that, in any action or proceeding brought under the antitrust laws, collateral estoppel effect shall not be given to any finding made by the Federal Trade Commission under the antitrust laws or under section 45 of this title which could give rise to a claim for relief under the antitrust laws.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:26 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Consent judgments and competitive impact statements; publication in Federal Register; availability of copies to the public</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any proposal for a consent judgment submitted by the United States for entry in any civil proceeding brought by or on behalf of the United States under the antitrust laws shall be filed with the district court before which such proceeding is pending and published by the United States in the Federal Register at least 60 days prior to the effective date of such judgment. Any written comments relating to such proposal and any responses by the United States thereto, shall also be filed with such district court and published by the United States in the Federal Register within such sixty-day period. Copies of such proposal and any other materials and documents which the United States considered determinative in formulating such proposal, shall also be made available to the public at the district court and in such other districts as the court may subsequently direct. Simultaneously with the filing of such proposal, unless otherwise instructed by the court, the United States shall file with the district court, publish in the Federal Register, and thereafter furnish to any person upon request, a competitive impact statement which shall recite&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the nature and purpose of the proceeding;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a description of the practices or events giving rise to the alleged violation of the antitrust laws;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Consideration of public comments by Attorney General and publication of response</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">During the 60-day period as specified in subsection (b) of this section, and such additional time as the United States may request and the court may grant, the United States shall receive and consider any written comments relating to the proposal for the consent judgment submitted under subsection (b). The Attorney General or his designee shall establish procedures to carry out the provisions of this subsection, but such 60-day time period shall not be shortened except by order of the district court upon a showing that (1) extraordinary circumstances require such shortening and (2) such shortening is not adverse to the public interest. At the close of the period during which such comments may be received, the United States shall file with the district court and cause to be published in the Federal Register a response to such comments. Upon application by the United States, the district court may, for good cause (based on a finding that the expense of publication in the Federal Register exceeds the public interest benefits to be gained from such publication), authorize an alternative method of public dissemination of the public comments received and the response to those comments.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Public interest determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Before entering any consent judgment proposed by the United States under this section, the court shall determine that the entry of such judgment is in the public interest. For the purpose of such determination, the court shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the competitive impact of such judgment, including termination of alleged violations, provisions for enforcement and modification, duration of relief sought, anticipated effects of alternative remedies actually considered, whether its terms are ambiguous, and any other competitive considerations bearing upon the adequacy of such judgment that the court deems necessary to a determination of whether the consent judgment is in the public interest; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the impact of entry of such judgment upon competition in the relevant market or markets, upon the public generally and individuals alleging specific injury from the violations set forth in the complaint including consideration of the public benefit, if any, to be derived from a determination of the issues at trial.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Nothing in this section shall be construed to require the court to conduct an evidentiary hearing or to require the court to permit anyone to intervene.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) appoint a special master and such outside consultants or expert witnesses as the court may deem appropriate; and request and obtain the views, evaluations, or advice of any individual, group or agency of government with respect to any aspects of the proposed judgment or the effect of such judgment, in such manner as the court deems appropriate;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:27 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) authorize full or limited participation in proceedings before the court by interested persons or agencies, including appearance amicus curiae, intervention as a party pursuant to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, examination of witnesses or documentary materials, or participation in any other manner and extent which serves the public interest as the court may deem appropriate;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) review any comments including any objections filed with the United States under subsection (d) concerning the proposed judgment and the responses of the United States to such comments and objections; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) take such other action in the public interest as the court may deem appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Filing of written or oral communications with the district court</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not later than 10 days following the date of the filing of any proposal for a consent judgment under subsection (b), each defendant shall file with the district court a description of any and all written or oral communications by or on behalf of such defendant, including any and all written or oral communications on behalf of such defendant by any officer, director, employee, or agent of such defendant, or other person, with any officer or employee of the United States concerning or relevant to such proposal, except that any such communications made by counsel of record alone with the Attorney General or the employees of the Department of Justice alone shall be excluded from the requirements of this subsection.

<h4 class="note-head"><strong>Statutory Notes and Related Subsidiaries</strong></h4>
<h4 class="note-head">Findings and Purpose</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 117&ndash;328, div. GG, title II, &sect;201, Dec. 29, 2022, 136 Stat. 5969, provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(1) Foreign subsidies, which can take the form of direct subsidies, grants, loans (including below-market loans), loan guarantees, tax concessions, preferential government procurement policies, or government ownership or control, can distort the competitive process by enabling the subsidized firm to submit a bid higher than other firms in the market, or otherwise change the incentives of the firm in ways that undermine competition following an acquisition.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(2) Foreign subsidies are particularly problematic when granted by countries or entities that constitute a strategic or economic threat to United States interests.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(3) The Made in China 2025 plan, states that the Chinese Communist Party will &apos;support enterprises to carry out mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A), equity investment, and venture capital overseas&apos;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(4) The 2020 report to Congress from the bipartisan U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission concluded that the Chinese Government subsidizes companies with a goal of their expanding into the United States and other countries, finding that &apos;[t]his process assists Chinese national champions in surpassing and supplanting global market leaders&apos;. The report warns that the risk is particularly acute when it comes to emerging technologies, where China seeks to &apos;surpass and displace the United States altogether [and that] [f]ailure to appreciate the gravity of this challenge and defend U.S. competitiveness would be dire&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. [and] risks setting back U.S. economic and technological progress for decades&apos;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(5) In remarks before the Hudson Institute on December 8, 2020, FTC Commissioner Noah Phillips stated, &apos;[O]ne area where antitrust needs to reckon with the strategic interests of other nations is when we scrutinize mergers or conduct involving state-owned entities&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. companies that are controlled, to varying degrees, by the state&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. [and] often are a government tool for implementing industrial policies or to protect national security&apos;.</p>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(b) <cap-smallcap>Purpose</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The purpose of this section [probably means &quot;this title&quot;, enacting this section and this note] is to require parties providing pre-merger notifications to include in the notification required under section 7A of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 18a) information concerning subsidies they receive from countries or entities that are strategic or economic threats to the United States.&quot;</p>

As soon as practicable, but not later than January 31 of each year, the Federal Trade Commission shall publish the adjusted amounts required by this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) When any person elected or chosen as a director or officer of any corporation subject to the provisions hereof is eligible at the time of his election or selection to act for such corporation in such capacity, his eligibility to act in such capacity shall not be affected by any of the provisions hereof by reason of any change in the capital, surplus and undivided profits, or affairs of such corporation from whatever cause, until the expiration of one year from the date on which the event causing ineligibility occurred.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Whenever the Commission, Board, or Secretary vested with jurisdiction thereof shall have reason to believe that any person is violating or has violated any of the provisions of sections 13, 14, 18, and 19 of this title, it shall issue and serve upon such person and the Attorney General a complaint stating its charges in that respect, and containing a notice of a hearing upon a day and at a place therein fixed at least thirty days after the service of said complaint. The person so complained of shall have the right to appear at the place and time so fixed and show cause why an order should not be entered by the Commission, Board, or Secretary requiring such person to cease and desist from the violation of the law so charged in said complaint. The Attorney General shall have the right to intervene and appear in said proceeding and any person may make application, and upon good cause shown may be allowed by the Commission, Board, or Secretary, to intervene and appear in said proceeding by counsel or in person. The testimony in any such proceeding shall be reduced to writing and filed in the office of the Commission, Board, or Secretary. If upon such hearing the Commission, Board, or Secretary, as the case may be, shall be of the opinion that any of the provisions of said sections have been or are being violated, it shall make a report in writing, in which it shall state its findings as to the facts, and shall issue and cause to be served on such person an order requiring such person to cease and desist from such violations, and divest itself of the stock, or other share capital, or assets, held or rid itself of the directors chosen contrary to the provisions of sections 18 and 19 of this title, if any there be, in the manner and within the time fixed by said order. Until the expiration of the time allowed for filing a petition for review, if no such petition has been duly filed within such time, or, if a petition for review has been filed within such time then until the record in the proceeding has been filed in a court of appeals of the United States, as hereinafter provided, the Commission, Board, or <!-- PDFPage:36 -->Secretary may at any time, upon such notice and in such manner as it shall deem proper, modify or set aside, in whole or in part, any report or any order made or issued by it under this section. After the expiration of the time allowed for filing a petition for review, if no such petition has been duly filed within such time, the Commission, Board, or Secretary may at any time, after notice and opportunity for hearing, reopen and alter, modify, or set aside, in whole or in part, any report or order made or issued by it under this section, whenever in the opinion of the Commission, Board, or Secretary conditions of fact or of law have so changed as to require such action or if the public interest shall so require: <i>Provided, however</i>, That the said person may, within sixty days after service upon him or it of said report or order entered after such a reopening, obtain a review thereof in the appropriate court of appeals of the United States, in the manner provided in subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Review of orders; jurisdiction; filing of petition and record of proceeding; conclusiveness of findings; additional evidence; modification of findings; finality of judgment and decree</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any person required by such order of the commission, board, or Secretary to cease and desist from any such violation may obtain a review of such order in the court of appeals of the United States for any circuit within which such violation occurred or within which such person resides or carries on business, by filing in the court, within sixty days after the date of the service of such order, a written petition praying that the order of the commission, board, or Secretary be set aside. A copy of such petition shall be forthwith transmitted by the clerk of the court to the commission, board, or Secretary, and thereupon the commission, board, or Secretary shall file in the court the record in the proceeding, as provided in section 2112 of title 28. Upon such filing of the petition the court shall have jurisdiction of the proceeding and of the question determined therein concurrently with the commission, board, or Secretary until the filing of the record, and shall have power to make and enter a decree affirming, modifying, or setting aside the order of the commission, board, or Secretary, and enforcing the same to the extent that such order is affirmed, and to issue such writs as are ancillary to its jurisdiction or are necessary in its judgment to prevent injury to the public or to competitors pendente lite. The findings of the commission, board, or Secretary as to the facts, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive. To the extent that the order of the commission, board, or Secretary is affirmed, the court shall issue its own order commanding obedience to the terms of such order of the commission, board, or Secretary. If either party shall apply to the court for leave to adduce additional evidence, and shall show to the satisfaction of the court that such additional evidence is material and that there were reasonable grounds for the failure to adduce such evidence in the proceeding before the commission, board, or Secretary, the court may order such additional evidence to be taken before the commission, board, or Secretary, and to be adduced upon the hearing in such manner and upon such terms and conditions as to the court may seem proper. The commission, board, or Secretary may modify its findings as to the facts, or make new findings, by reason of the additional evidence so taken, and shall file such modified or new findings, which if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive, and its recommendation, if any, for the modification or setting aside of its original order, with the return of such additional evidence. The judgment and decree of the court shall be final, except that the same shall be subject to review by the Supreme Court upon certiorari, as provided in section 1254 of title 28.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Exclusive jurisdiction of Court of Appeals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon the filing of the record with its jurisdiction of the court of appeals to affirm, enforce, modify, or set aside orders of the commission, board, or Secretary shall be exclusive.</p>

The verified return by the person so serving said complaint, order, or other process setting forth the manner of said service shall be proof of the same, and the return post office receipt for said complaint, order, or other process mailed by registered or certified mail as aforesaid shall be proof of the service of the same.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Finality of orders generally</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any order issued under subsection (b) shall become final&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) upon the expiration of the time allowed for filing a petition for review, if no such petition has been duly filed within such time; but the commission, board, or Secretary may thereafter modify or set aside its order to the extent provided in the last sentence of subsection (b); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) upon the expiration of the time allowed for filing a petition for certiorari, if the order of the commission, board, or Secretary has been affirmed, or the petition for review has been dismissed by the court of appeals, and no petition for certiorari has been duly filed; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) upon the denial of a petition for certiorari, if the order of the commission, board, or Secretary has been affirmed or the petition for <!-- PDFPage:37 -->review has been dismissed by the court of appeals; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) upon the expiration of thirty days from the date of issuance of the mandate of the Supreme Court, if such Court directs that the order of the commission, board, or Secretary be affirmed or the petition for review be dismissed.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">If the Supreme Court directs that the order of the commission, board, or Secretary be modified or set aside, the order of the commission, board, or Secretary rendered in accordance with the mandate of the Supreme Court shall become final upon the expiration of thirty days from the time it was rendered, unless within such thirty days either party has instituted proceedings to have such order corrected to accord with the mandate, in which event the order of the commission, board, or Secretary shall become final when so corrected.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Finality of orders modified by Court of Appeals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the order of the commission, board, or Secretary is modified or set aside by the court of appeals, and if (1) the time allowed for filing a petition for certiorari has expired and no such petition has been duly filed, or (2) the petition for certiorari has been denied, or (3) the decision of the court has been affirmed by the Supreme Court then the order of the commission, board, or Secretary rendered in accordance with the mandate of the court of appeals shall become final on the expiration of thirty days from the time such order of the commission, board, or Secretary was rendered, unless within such thirty days either party has instituted proceedings to have such order corrected so that it will accord with the mandate, in which event the order of the commission, board, or Secretary shall become final when so corrected.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) &quot;Mandate&quot; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As used in this section the term &quot;mandate&quot;, in case a mandate has been recalled prior to the expiration of thirty days from the date of issuance thereof, means the final mandate.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;37b. Confirmation of antitrust status of graduate medical resident matching programs</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings and purposes</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) For over 50 years, most United States medical school seniors and the large majority of graduate medical education programs (popularly known as &quot;residency programs&quot;) have chosen to use a matching program to match medical students with residency programs to which they have applied. These matching programs have been an integral part of an educational system that has produced the finest physicians and medical researchers in the world.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Before such matching programs were instituted, medical students often felt pressure, at an unreasonably early stage of their medical education, to seek admission to, and accept offers from, residency programs. As a result, medical students often made binding commitments before they were in a position <!-- PDFPage:46 -->to make an informed decision about a medical specialty or a residency program and before residency programs could make an informed assessment of students&apos; qualifications. This situation was inefficient, chaotic, and unfair and it often led to placements that did not serve the interests of either medical students or residency programs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) The original matching program, now operated by the independent non-profit National Resident Matching Program and popularly known as &quot;the Match&quot;, was developed and implemented more than 50 years ago in response to widespread student complaints about the prior process. This Program includes on its board of directors individuals nominated by medical student organizations as well as by major medical education and hospital associations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) The Match uses a computerized mathematical algorithm, as students had recommended, to analyze the preferences of students and residency programs and match students with their highest preferences from among the available positions in residency programs that listed them. Students thus obtain a residency position in the most highly ranked program on their list that has ranked them sufficiently high among its preferences. Each year, about 85 percent of participating United States medical students secure a place in one of their top 3 residency program choices.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) Antitrust lawsuits challenging the matching process, regardless of their merit or lack thereof, have the potential to undermine this highly efficient, pro-competitive, and long-standing process. The costs of defending such litigation would divert the scarce resources of our country's teaching hospitals and medical schools from their crucial missions of patient care, physician training, and medical research. In addition, such costs may lead to abandonment of the matching process, which has effectively served the interests of medical students, teaching hospitals, and patients for over half a century.</p>
