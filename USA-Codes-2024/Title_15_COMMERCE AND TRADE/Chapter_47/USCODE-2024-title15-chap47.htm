<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) an unacceptable number of consumer products which present unreasonable risks of injury are distributed in commerce;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) complexities of consumer products and the diverse nature and abilities of consumers using them frequently result in an inability of users to anticipate risks and to safeguard themselves adequately;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the public should be protected against unreasonable risks of injury associated with consumer products;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) control by State and local governments of unreasonable risks of injury associated with consumer products is inadequate and may be burdensome to manufacturers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) existing Federal authority to protect consumers from exposure to consumer products presenting unreasonable risks of injury is inadequate; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) regulation of consumer products the distribution or use of which affects interstate or foreign commerce is necessary to carry out this chapter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The purposes of this chapter are&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to protect the public against unreasonable risks of injury associated with consumer products;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to assist consumers in evaluating the comparative safety of consumer products;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to develop uniform safety standards for consumer products and to minimize conflicting State and local regulations; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to promote research and investigation into the causes and prevention of product-related deaths, illnesses, and injuries.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Disclosure requirements for manufacturers or private labelers; procedures applicable</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Nothing contained in this Act shall be construed to require the release of any information described by subsection (b) of section 552 of title 5 or which is otherwise protected by law from disclosure to the public.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) All information reported to or otherwise obtained by the Commission or its representative under this Act which information contains or relates to a trade secret or other matter referred to in section 1905 of title 18 or subject to section 552(b)(4) of title 5 shall be considered confidential and shall not be disclosed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Commission shall, prior to the disclosure of any information which will permit the public to ascertain readily the identity of a manufacturer or private labeler of a consumer product, offer such manufacturer or private labeler an opportunity to mark such information as confidential and therefore barred from disclosure under paragraph (2). A manufacturer or private labeler shall submit any such mark within 15 calendar days after the date on which it receives the Commission's offer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) All information that a manufacturer or private labeler has marked to be confidential and barred from disclosure under paragraph (2), either at the time of submission or pursuant to paragraph (3), shall not be disclosed, except in accordance with the procedures established in paragraphs (5) and (6).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) If the Commission determines that a document marked as confidential by a manufacturer or private labeler to be barred from disclosure under paragraph (2) may be disclosed because it is not confidential information as provided in paragraph (2), the Commission shall notify such person in writing that the Commission intends to disclose such document at a date not less than 10 days after the date of receipt of notification.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Any person receiving such notification may, if he believes such disclosure is barred by paragraph (2), before the date set for release of the document, bring an action in the district court of the United States in the district in which the complainant resides, or has his principal place or business, or in which the documents are located, or in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia to restrain disclosure of the document. Any person receiving such notification may file with the appropriate district court or court of appeals of the United States, as appropriate, an application for a stay of disclosure. The documents shall not be disclosed until the court has ruled on the application for a stay.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) Nothing in this Act shall authorize the withholding of information by the Commission or any officer or employee under its control from the duly authorized committees or subcommittees of the Congress, and the provisions of paragraphs (2) through (6) shall not apply to such disclosures, except that the Commission shall immediately notify the manufacturer or private labeler of any such request for information designated as confidential by the manufacturer or private labeler.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) The provisions of paragraphs (2) through (6) shall not prohibit the disclosure of information to other officers, employees, or representatives of the Commission (including contractors) concerned with carrying out this Act or when relevant in any administrative proceeding under this Act or in judicial proceedings to which the Commission is a party.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Additional disclosure requirements for manufacturers or private labelers; procedures applicable</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided by paragraph (4) of this subsection, not less than 15 days prior to its public disclosure of any information obtained under this Act, or to be disclosed to the public in connection therewith (unless the Commission publishes a finding that the public health and safety requires a lesser period of notice), the Commission shall, to the extent practicable, notify and provide a summary of the information to, each manufacturer or private labeler of any consumer product to which such information pertains, if the manner in which such consumer product is to be designated or described in such information will permit the public to ascertain readily the identity of such manufacturer or private labeler, and shall provide such manufacturer or private labeler with a reasonable opportunity to submit comments to the Commission in regard to such information. The Commission shall take reasonable steps to assure, prior to its public disclosure thereof, that information from which the identity of such manufacturer or private labeler may be readily ascertained is accurate, and that such disclosure is fair in the circumstances and reasonably related to effectuating the purposes of this Act. In disclosing any information under this subsection, the Commission may, and upon the request of the manufacturer or private labeler shall, include with the disclosure any comments or other information or a summary thereof submitted by such manufacturer or private labeler to the extent permitted by and subject to the requirements of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the Commission determines that a document claimed to be inaccurate by a manufacturer or private labeler under paragraph (1) should be disclosed because the Commission believes it has complied with paragraph (1), the Commission shall notify the manufacturer or <!-- PDFPage:1709 -->private labeler that the Commission intends to disclose such document at a date not less than 5 days after the date of the receipt of notification. The Commission may provide a lesser period of notice of intent to disclose if the Commission publishes a finding that the public health and safety requires a lesser period of notice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Prior to the date set for release of the document, the manufacturer or private labeler receiving the notice described in paragraph (2) may bring an action in the district court of the United States in the district in which the complainant resides, or has his principal place of business, or in which the documents are located or in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia to enjoin disclosure of the document. The district court may enjoin such disclosure if the Commission has failed to take the reasonable steps prescribed in paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the Commission determines that the public health and safety requires expedited consideration of an action brought under subparagraph (A), the Commission may file a request with the District Court for such expedited consideration. If the Commission files such a request, the District Court shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) assign the matter for hearing at the earliest possible date;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(5) In addition to the requirements of paragraph (1), the Commission shall not disclose to the public information submitted pursuant to section 2064(b) of this title respecting a consumer product unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the Commission has issued a complaint under section 2064(c) or (d) of this title alleging that such product presents a substantial product hazard;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in lieu of proceeding against such product under section 2064(c) or (d) of this title, the Commission has accepted in writing a remedial settlement agreement dealing with such product;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the person who submitted the information under section 2064(b) of this title agrees to its public disclosure; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the Commission publishes a finding that the public health and safety requires public disclosure with a lesser period of notice than is required under paragraph (1).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to the public disclosure of information with respect to a consumer product which is the subject of an action brought under section 2061 of this title, or which the Commission has reasonable cause to believe is in violation of any consumer product safety rule or provision under this Act or similar rule or provision of any other Act enforced by the Commission, or information in the course of or concerning a judicial proceeding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Where the Commission initiates the public disclosure of information that reflects on the safety of a consumer product or class of consumer products, whether or not such information would enable the public to ascertain readily the identity of a manufacturer or private labeler, the Commission shall establish procedures designed to ensure that such information is accurate and not misleading.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) If the Commission finds that, in the administration of this Act, it has made public disclosure of inaccurate or misleading information which reflects adversely upon the safety of any consumer product or class of consumer products, or the practices of any manufacturer, private labeler, distributor, or retailer of consumer products, it shall, in a manner equivalent to that in which such disclosure was made, take reasonable steps to publish a retraction of such inaccurate or misleading information.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) If, after the commencement of a rulemaking or the initiation of an adjudicatory proceeding, the Commission decides to terminate the proceeding before taking final action, the Commission shall, in a manner equivalent to that in which such commencement or initiation was publicized, take reasonable steps to make known the decision to terminate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Communications with manufacturers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall communicate to each manufacturer of a consumer product, insofar as may be practicable, information as to any significant risk of injury associated with such product.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2056. Consumer product safety standards</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Types of requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission may promulgate consumer product safety standards in accordance with the provisions of section 2058 of this title. A consumer product safety standard shall consist of one or more of any of the following types of requirements:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Requirements expressed in terms of performance requirements.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Requirements that a consumer product be marked with or accompanied by clear and adequate warnings or instructions, or requirements respecting the form of warnings or instructions.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Any requirement of such a standard shall be reasonably necessary to prevent or reduce an unreasonable risk of injury associated with such product.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Reliance of Commission upon voluntary standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Commission shall rely upon voluntary consumer product safety standards rather than promulgate a consumer product safety standard prescribing requirements described in subsection (a) whenever compliance with such voluntary standards would eliminate or adequately reduce the risk of injury addressed and it is likely that there will be substantial compliance with such voluntary standards.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission shall devise procedures to monitor compliance with any voluntary standards&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) upon which the Commission has relied under paragraph (1);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) which were developed with the participation of the Commission; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) whose development the Commission has monitored.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Contribution of Commission to development cost</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If any person participates with the Commission in the development of a consumer product safety standard, the Commission may agree to contribute to the person's cost with respect to such participation, in any case in which the Commission determines that such contribution is likely to result in a more satisfactory standard than would be developed without such contribution, and that the person is financially responsible. Regulations of the Commission shall set forth the items of cost in which it may participate, and shall exclude any contribution to the acquisition of land or buildings. Payments under agreements entered into under this subsection may be made without regard to section 3324(a) and (b) of title 31.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Short title</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This section may be cited as the &quot;Danny Keysar Child Product Safety Notification Act&quot;.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Safety standards</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in consultation with representatives of consumer groups, juvenile product manufacturers, and independent child product engineers and experts, examine and assess the effectiveness of any voluntary consumer product safety standards for durable infant or toddler products; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in accordance with section 553 of title 5, promulgate consumer product safety standards that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) are substantially the same as such voluntary standards; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) are more stringent than such voluntary standards, if the Commission determines that more stringent standards would further reduce the risk of injury associated with such products.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Timetable for rulemaking</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Not later than 1 year after August 14, 2008, the Commission shall commence the rulemaking required under paragraph (1) and shall promulgate standards for no fewer than 2 categories of durable infant or toddler products every 6 months thereafter, beginning with the product categories that the Commission determines to be of highest priority, until the Commission has promulgated standards for all such product categories. Thereafter, the Commission shall periodically review and revise the standards set forth under this subsection to ensure that such standards provide the highest level of safety for such products that is feasible.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Judicial review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any person adversely affected by such standards may file a petition for review under the procedures set forth in section 2060(g) of this title, as added by section 236 of this Act.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Process for considering subsequent revisions to voluntary standard</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Notice of adoption of voluntary standard</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">When the Commission promulgates a consumer product safety standard under this subsection that is based, in whole or in part, on a voluntary standard, the Commission shall notify the organization that issued the voluntary standard of the Commission's action and shall provide a copy of the consumer product safety standard to the organization.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Commission action on revised voluntary standard</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If an organization revises a standard that has been adopted, in whole or in part, as a <!-- PDFPage:1717 -->consumer product safety standard under this subsection, it shall notify the Commission. The revised voluntary standard shall be considered to be a consumer product safety standard issued by the Commission under section 2058 of this title, effective 180 days after the date on which the organization notifies the Commission (or such later date specified by the Commission in the Federal Register) unless, within 90 days after receiving that notice, the Commission notifies the organization that it has determined that the proposed revision does not improve the safety of the consumer product covered by the standard and that the Commission is retaining the existing consumer product safety standard.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Cribs</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">It shall be a violation of section 2068(a)(1) of this title for any person to which this subsection applies to manufacture, sell, contract to sell or resell, lease, sublet, offer, provide for use, or otherwise place in the stream of commerce a crib that is not in compliance with a standard promulgated under subsection (b).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Persons to which subsection applies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">This subsection applies to any person that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) manufactures, distributes in commerce, or contracts to sell cribs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) based on the person's occupation, holds itself out as having knowledge or skill peculiar to cribs, including child care facilities and family child care homes;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) is in the business of contracting to sell or resell, lease, sublet, or otherwise place cribs in the stream of commerce; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) owns or operates a place of public accommodation affecting commerce (as defined in section 2203 of this title applied without regard to the phrase &quot;not owned by the Federal Government&quot;).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Application of any revision</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">With respect to any revision of the standard promulgated under subsection (b)(1)(B) subsequent to the initial promulgation of a standard under such subsection, paragraph (1) shall apply only to a person that manufactures or imports cribs, unless the Commission determines that application to any other person described in paragraph (2) is necessary to protect against an unreasonable risk to health or safety. If the Commission determines that application to a person described in paragraph (2) is necessary, it shall provide not less than 12 months for such person to come into compliance.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Crib defined</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to provide consumers with a postage-paid consumer registration form with each such product;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to maintain a record of the names, addresses, e-mail addresses, and other contact information of consumers who register their ownership of such products with the manufacturer in order to improve the effectiveness of manufacturer campaigns to recall such products; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) to permanently place the manufacturer name and contact information, model name and number, and the date of manufacture on each durable infant or toddler product.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Requirements for registration form</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The registration form required to be provided to consumers under paragraph (1) shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) include spaces for a consumer to provide the consumer's name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) include space sufficiently large to permit easy, legible recording of all desired information;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) include the manufacturer's name, model name and number for the product, and the date of manufacture;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) include a message explaining the purpose of the registration and designed to encourage consumers to complete the registration;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) include an option for consumers to register through the Internet; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) include a statement that information provided by the consumer shall not be used for any purpose other than to facilitate a recall of or safety alert regarding that product.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">In issuing regulations under this section, the Commission may prescribe the exact text and format of the required registration form.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Record keeping and notification requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The rules required under this section shall require each manufacturer of a durable infant or toddler product to maintain a record of registrants for each product manufactured that includes all of the information provided by each consumer registered, and to use such information to notify such consumers in the event of a voluntary or involuntary recall of or safety alert regarding such product. Each manufacturer shall maintain such a record for a period of not less than 6 years after the date of manufacture of the product. Consumer information collected by a manufacturer under this Act may not be used by the manufacturer, nor disseminated by such manufacturer to any <!-- PDFPage:1718 -->other party, for any purpose other than notification to such consumer in the event of a product recall or safety alert.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Study</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission shall conduct a study at such time as it considers appropriate on the effectiveness of the consumer registration forms required by this section in facilitating product recalls and whether such registration forms should be required for other children's products. Not later than 4 years after August 14, 2008, the Commission shall report its findings to the appropriate Congressional committees.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Use of alternative recall notification technology</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Technology assessment and report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) beginning 2 years after a rule is promulgated under subsection (d), regularly review recall notification technology and assess the effectiveness of such technology in facilitating recalls of durable infant or toddler products; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) not later than 3 years after August 14, 2008, and periodically thereafter as the Commission considers appropriate, transmit a report on such assessments to the appropriate Congressional committees.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Beginning 180 days after August 14, 2008, the provisions of ASTM International Standard F963&ndash;07 Consumer Safety Specifications for Toy Safety (ASTM F963), as it exists on August 14, 2008 (except for section 4.2 and Annex 4 or any provision that restates or incorporates an existing mandatory standard or ban promulgated by the Commission or by statute or any provision that restates or incorporates a regulation promulgated by the Food and Drug Administration or any statute administered by the Food and Drug Administration) shall be considered to be consumer product safety standards issued by the Commission under section 2058 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Rulemaking for specific toys, components and risks</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Evaluation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Not later than 1 year after August 14, 2008, the Commission, in consultation with representatives of consumer groups, juvenile product manufacturers, and independent child product engineers and experts, shall examine and assess the effectiveness of ASTM F963 or its successor standard (except for section 4.2 and Annex 4), as it relates to safety requirements, safety labeling requirements, and test methods related to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) internal harm or injury hazards caused by the ingestion or inhalation of magnets in children's products;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1719 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) toxic substances;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) toys with spherical ends;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) hemispheric-shaped objects;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) cords, straps, and elastics; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) battery-operated toys.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Rulemaking</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 1 year after the completion of the assessment required by paragraph (1), the Commission shall promulgate rules in accordance with section 553 of title 5 that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) take into account other children's product safety rules; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) are more stringent than such standards, if the Commission determines that more stringent standards would further reduce the risk of injury of such toys.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Periodic review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall periodically review and revise the rules set forth under this section to ensure that such rules provide the highest level of safety for such products that is feasible.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Consideration of remaining ASTM standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">After promulgating the rules required by subsection (b), the Commission shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in consultation with representatives of consumer groups, juvenile product manufacturers, and independent child product engineers and experts, examine and assess the effectiveness of ASTM F963 (and alternative health protective requirements to prevent or minimize flammability of children's products) or its successor standard, and shall assess the adequacy of such standards in protecting children from safety hazards; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in accordance with section 553 of title 5, promulgate consumer product safety rules that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) take into account other children's product safety rules; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) are more stringent than such standards, if the Commission determines that more stringent standards would further reduce the risk of injury associated with such toys.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Prioritization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall promulgate rules beginning with the product categories that the Commission determines to be of highest priority, until the Commission has promulgated standards for all such product categories.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Treatment as consumer product safety standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Rules issued under this section shall be considered consumer product safety standards issued by the Commission under section 2058 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Revisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If ASTM International (or its successor entity) proposes to revise ASTM F963&ndash;07, or a successor standard, it shall notify the Commission of the proposed revision. The Commission shall incorporate the revision or a section of the revision into the consumer product safety rule. The revised standard shall be considered to be a consumer product safety standard issued by the Consumer Product Safety Commission under section 2058 of this title, effective 180 days after the date on which ASTM International notifies the Commission of the revision unless, within 90 days after receiving that notice, the Commission notifies ASTM International that it has determined that the proposed revision does not improve the safety of the consumer product covered by the standard. If the Commission so notifies ASTM International with respect to a proposed revision of the standard, the existing standard shall continue to be considered to be a consumer product safety rule without regard to the proposed revision.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Rulemaking to consider exemption from preemption</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Exemption of State law from preemption</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Upon application of a State or political subdivision of a State, the Commission shall, after notice and opportunity for oral presentation of views, consider a rulemaking to exempt from the provisions of section 2075(a) of this title (under such conditions as it may impose in the rule) any proposed safety standard or regulation which is described in such application and which is designed to protect against a risk of injury associated with a children's product subject to the consumer product safety standards described in subsection (a) or any rule promulgated under this section. The Commission shall grant such an exemption if the State or political subdivision standard or regulation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) provides a significantly higher degree of protection from such risk of injury than the consumer product safety standard or rule under this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) does not unduly burden interstate commerce.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">In determining the burden, if any, of a State or political subdivision standard or regulation on interstate commerce, the Commission shall consider and make appropriate (as determined by the Commission in its discretion) findings on the technological and economic feasibility of complying with such standard or regulation, the cost of complying with such standard or regulation, the geographic distribution of the consumer product to which the standard or regulation would apply, the probability of other States or political subdivisions applying for an exemption under this subsection for a similar standard or regulation, and the need for a national, uniform standard under this Act for such consumer product.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Effect of standards on established State laws</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this section or in section 2075 of this title shall prevent a State or political subdivision of a State from continuing in effect a safety requirement applicable to a toy or other children's product that is designed to deal with the same risk of injury as the consumer product safety standards established by this section and that is in effect on the day before August 14, 2008, if such State or political subdivision has filed such requirement with the Commission within 90 days after August 14, 2008, in such form and in such manner as the Commission may require.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1720 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Judicial review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The issuance of any rule under this section is subject to judicial review as provided in section 2060(g) of this title, as added by section 236 of this Act.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Requirements for warning labels</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Warning labels required under subsection (a)(2) shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) clearly identify the hazard of ingestion; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) instruct consumers, as practicable, to keep new and used batteries out of the reach of children, to seek immediate medical attention if a battery is ingested, and to follow any other consensus medical advice.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Treatment of standard for enforcement purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A consumer product safety standard promulgated under subsection (a) shall be treated as a consumer product safety rule promulgated under section 2058 of this title.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Determination required to be published in Federal Register</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any determination made by the Commission under this subsection shall be published in the Federal Register.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Treatment of voluntary standard for enforcement purposes</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Commission makes a determination under subsection (d) with respect to a voluntary standard, the requirements of such voluntary standard shall be treated as a consumer product safety rule promulgated under section 2058 of this title beginning on the date described in paragraph (2).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Beginning on the date that is 180 days after the Commission is notified of a revised voluntary standard described in paragraph (1) (or such later date as the Commission determines appropriate), such revised voluntary standard in whole or in part shall be considered to be a consumer product safety rule promulgated under section 2058 of this title, in place of the prior version, unless, within 90 days after receiving the notice, the Commission notifies the organization that the revised voluntary standard, in whole or in part, does not improve the safety of the consumer product covered by the standard and that the Commission is retaining all or part of the existing consumer product safety standard.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Future rulemaking</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">At any time after the promulgation of a final consumer product safety standard under subsection (a), a voluntary standard is treated as a consumer product safety rule under subsection (e), or a revised voluntary standard becomes enforceable as a consumer product safety rule under subsection (f), the Commission may initiate a rulemaking in accordance with section 553 of title 5 to modify the requirements of the standard or revised standard. Any rule promulgated under this subsection shall be treated as a consumer product safety rule promulgated under section 2058 of this title.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Prohibition on the sale of additional products containing certain phthalates</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Interim prohibition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Beginning on the date that is 180 days after August 14, 2008, and until a final rule is promulgated under paragraph (3), it shall be unlawful for any person to manufacture for sale, offer for sale, distribute in commerce, or import into the United States any children's toy that can be placed in a child's mouth or child care article that contains concentrations of more than 0.1 percent of diisononyl phthalate (DINP), diisodecyl phthalate (DIDP), or di-n-octyl phthalate (DnOP).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Chronic Hazard Advisory Panel</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Appointment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Not earlier than 180 days after August 14, 2008, the Commission shall begin the process of appointing a Chronic Hazard Advisory Panel pursuant to the procedures of section 28 of the Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2077) to study the effects on children's health of all phthalates and phthalate alternatives as used in children's toys and child care articles.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Examination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The panel shall, within 18 months after its appointment under subparagraph (A), complete an examination of the full range of phthalates that are used in products for children and shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) examine all of the potential health effects (including endocrine disrupting effects) of the full range of phthalates;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) consider the potential health effects of each of these phthalates both in isolation and in combination with other phthalates;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) examine the likely levels of children's, pregnant women's, and others&apos; exposure to phthalates, based on a reasonable estimation of normal and foreseeable use and abuse of such products;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) consider the cumulative effect of total exposure to phthalates, both from <!-- PDFPage:1727 -->children's products and from other sources, such as personal care products;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) review all relevant data, including the most recent, best-available, peer-reviewed, scientific studies of these phthalates and phthalate alternatives that employ objective data collection practices or employ other objective methods;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vi) consider the health effects of phthalates not only from ingestion but also as a result of dermal, hand-to-mouth, or other exposure;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vii) consider the level at which there is a reasonable certainty of no harm to children, pregnant women, or other susceptible individuals and their offspring, considering the best available science, and using sufficient safety factors to account for uncertainties regarding exposure and susceptibility of children, pregnant women, and other potentially susceptible individuals; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(viii) consider possible similar health effects of phthalate alternatives used in children's toys and child care articles.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em" style="padding-left:2em text-indent:0em">The panel's examinations pursuant to this paragraph shall be conducted <i>de novo</i>.

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Not later than 180 days after completing its examination, the panel appointed under subparagraph (A) shall report to the Commission the results of the examination conducted under this section and shall make recommendations to the Commission regarding any phthalates (or combinations of phthalates) in addition to those identified in subsection (a) or phthalate alternatives that the panel determines should be declared banned hazardous substances.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Permanent prohibition by rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Not later than 180 days after receiving the report of the panel under paragraph (2)(C), the Commission shall, pursuant to section 553 of title 5, promulgate a final rule to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) determine, based on such report, whether to continue in effect the prohibition under paragraph (1), in order to ensure a reasonable certainty of no harm to children, pregnant women, or other susceptible individuals with an adequate margin of safety; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) evaluate the findings and recommendations of the Chronic Hazard Advisory Panel and declare any children's product containing any phthalates to be a banned hazardous product under section 8 of the Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2057), as the Commission determines necessary to protect the health of children.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Application</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Effective on August 12, 2011,<sup><a href="#2057c_1_target" name="2057c_1">1</a></sup> subsections (a) and (b)(1) and any rule promulgated under subsection (b)(3) shall apply to any plasticized component part of a children's toy or child care article or any other component part of a children's toy or child care article that is made of other materials that may contain phthalates.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Exclusion for inaccessible component parts</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The prohibitions established under subsections (a) and (b) shall not apply to any component part of a children's toy or child care article that is not accessible to a child through normal and reasonably foreseeable use and abuse of such product, as determined by the Commission. A component part is not accessible under this paragraph if such component part is not physically exposed by reason of a sealed covering or casing and does not become physically exposed through reasonably foreseeable use and abuse of the product. Reasonably foreseeable use and abuse shall include swallowing, mouthing, breaking, or other children's activities, and the aging of the product.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission may revoke an exclusion or all exclusions granted under paragraph (1) at any time and require that any or all component parts manufactured after such exclusion is revoked comply with the prohibitions established under subsections (a) and (b) if the Commission finds, based on scientific evidence, that such compliance is necessary to protect the public health or safety.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Inaccessibility proceeding</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 1 year after August 12, 2011, the Commission shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) promulgate a rule providing guidance with respect to what product components, or classes of components, will be considered to be inaccessible for purposes of paragraph (1); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) adopt the same guidance with respect to inaccessibility that was adopted by the Commission with regards to accessibility of lead under section 1278a(b)(2)(B) of this title, with additional consideration, as appropriate, of whether such component can be placed in a child's mouth.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Application pending commission guidance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Until the Commission promulgates a rule pursuant to paragraph (3), the determination of whether a product component is inaccessible to a child shall be made in accordance with the requirements laid out in paragraph (1) for considering a component to be inaccessible to a child.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Treatment of violation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A violation of subsection (a) or (b)(1) or any rule promulgated by the Commission under subsection (b)(3) shall be treated as a violation of section 19(a)(1) of the Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2068(a)(1)).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Treatment as consumer product safety standards; effect on State laws</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subsections (a) and (b)(1) and any rule promulgated under subsection (b)(3) shall be considered consumer product safety standards under the <!-- PDFPage:1728 -->Consumer Product Safety Act [15 U.S.C. 2051 et seq.]. Nothing in this section or the Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2051 et seq.) shall be construed to preempt or otherwise affect any State requirement with respect to any phthalate alternative not specifically regulated in a consumer product safety standard under the Consumer Product Safety Act.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) invite any person (other than the Commission) to submit to the Commission, within such period as the Commission shall specify in the notice (which period shall not be less than 30 days after the date of publication of the notice), a statement of intention to modify or develop a voluntary consumer product safety standard to address the risk of injury identified in paragraph (1) together with a description of a plan to modify or develop the standard.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Commission shall transmit such notice within 10 calendar days to the appropriate Congressional committees.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Voluntary standard; publication as proposed rule; notice of reliance of Commission on standard</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If the Commission determines that any standard submitted to it in response to an invitation in a notice published under subsection (a)(5) if promulgated (in whole, in part, or in combination with any other standard submitted to the Commission or any part of such a standard) as a consumer product safety standard, would eliminate or adequately reduce the risk of injury identified in a notice under subsection (a)(1), the Commission may publish such standard, in whole, in part, or in such combination and with nonmaterial modifications, as a proposed consumer product safety rule.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the Commission determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) compliance with any standard submitted to it in response to an invitation in a notice published under subsection (a)(6) is likely to result in the elimination or adequate reduction of the risk of injury identified in the notice, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) it is likely that there will be substantial compliance with such standard,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the Commission shall terminate any proceeding to promulgate a consumer product safety rule respecting such risk of injury and shall publish in the Federal Register a notice which includes the determination of the Commission and which notifies the public that the Commission will rely on the voluntary standard to eliminate or reduce the risk of injury, except that the Commission shall terminate any such proceeding and rely on a voluntary standard only if such voluntary standard is in existence. For purposes of this section, a voluntary standard shall be considered to be in existence when it is finally approved by the organization or other person which developed such standard, irrespective of the effective date of the standard. Before relying upon any voluntary consumer product safety standard, the Commission shall afford interested persons (including manufacturers, consumers, and consumer organizations) a reasonable opportunity to submit written comments regarding such standard. The Commission shall consider such comments in making any determination regarding reliance on the involved voluntary standard under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Publication of proposed rule; preliminary regulatory analysis; contents; transmittal of notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No consumer product safety rule may be proposed by the Commission unless the Commission publishes in the Federal Register the text of the proposed rule, including any alternatives, which the Commission proposes to promulgate, together with a preliminary regulatory analysis containing&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a preliminary description of the potential benefits and potential costs of the proposed rule, including any benefits or costs that cannot be quantified in monetary terms, and an identification of those likely to receive the benefits and bear the costs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a discussion of the reasons any standard or portion of a standard submitted to the Commission under subsection (a)(5) was not published by the Commission as the proposed rule or part of the proposed rule;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) a discussion of the reasons for the Commission's preliminary determination that efforts proposed under subsection (a)(6) and assisted by the Commission as required by sec<!-- PDFPage:1730 -->tion 2054(a)(3) of this title would not, within a reasonable period of time, be likely to result in the development of a voluntary consumer product safety standard that would eliminate or adequately reduce the risk of injury addressed by the proposed rule; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) a description of any reasonable alternatives to the proposed rule, together with a summary description of their potential costs and benefits, and a brief explanation of why such alternatives should not be published as a proposed rule.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Commission shall transmit such notice within 10 calendar days to the appropriate Congressional committees. Any proposed consumer product safety rule shall be issued within twelve months after the date of publication of the notice, unless the Commission determines that such proposed rule is not reasonably necessary to eliminate or reduce the risk of injury associated with the product or is not in the public interest. The Commission may extend the twelve-month period for good cause. If the Commission extends such period, it shall immediately transmit notice of such extension to the appropriate Congressional committees. Such notice shall include an explanation of the reasons for such extension, together with an estimate of the date by which the Commission anticipates such rulemaking will be completed. The Commission shall publish notice of such extension and the information submitted to the Congress in the Federal Register. Nothing in this subsection shall preclude any person from submitting an existing standard or portion of a standard as a proposed consumer product safety standard.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Promulgation of rule; time</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Within 60 days after the publication under subsection (c) of a proposed consumer product safety rule respecting a risk of injury associated with a consumer product, the Commission shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) promulgate a consumer product safety rule respecting the risk of injury associated with such product, if it makes the findings required under subsection (f), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) withdraw the applicable notice of proposed rulemaking if it determines that such rule is not (i) reasonably necessary to eliminate or reduce an unreasonable risk of injury associated with the product, or (ii) in the public interest;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">except that the Commission may extend such 60-day period for good cause shown (if it publishes its reasons therefor in the Federal Register).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Consumer product safety rules shall be promulgated in accordance with section 553 of title 5, except that the Commission shall give interested persons an opportunity for the oral presentation of data, views, or arguments, in addition to an opportunity to make written submissions. A transcript shall be kept of any oral presentation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Expression of risk of injury; consideration of available product data; needs of elderly and handicapped</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A consumer product safety rule shall express in the rule itself the risk of injury which the standard is designed to eliminate or reduce. In promulgating such a rule the Commission shall consider relevant available product data including the results of research, development, testing, and investigation activities conducted generally and pursuant to this chapter. In the promulgation of such a rule the Commission shall also consider and take into account the special needs of elderly and handicapped persons to determine the extent to which such persons may be adversely affected by such rule.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Findings; final regulatory analysis; judicial review of rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Prior to promulgating a consumer product safety rule, the Commission shall consider, and shall make appropriate findings for inclusion in such rule with respect to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the degree and nature of the risk of injury the rule is designed to eliminate or reduce;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the approximate number of consumer products, or types or classes thereof, subject to such rule;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the need of the public for the consumer products subject to such rule, and the probable effect of such rule upon the utility, cost, or availability of such products to meet such need; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) any means of achieving the objective of the order while minimizing adverse effects on competition or disruption or dislocation of manufacturing and other commercial practices consistent with the public health and safety.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission shall not promulgate a consumer product safety rule unless it has prepared, on the basis of the findings of the Commission under paragraph (1) and on other information before the Commission, a final regulatory analysis of the rule containing the following information:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) A description of the potential benefits and potential costs of the rule, including costs and benefits that cannot be quantified in monetary terms, and the identification of those likely to receive the benefits and bear the costs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) A description of any alternatives to the final rule which were considered by the Commission, together with a summary description of their potential benefits and costs and a brief explanation of the reasons why these alternatives were not chosen.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) A summary of any significant issues raised by the comments submitted during the public comment period in response to the preliminary regulatory analysis, and a summary of the assessment by the Commission of such issues.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Commission shall publish its final regulatory analysis with the rule.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Commission shall not promulgate a consumer product safety rule unless it finds (and includes such finding in the rule)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) that the rule (including its effective date) is reasonably necessary to eliminate or reduce an unreasonable risk of injury associated with such product;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) that the promulgation of the rule is in the public interest;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1731 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) in the case of a rule declaring the product a banned hazardous product, that no feasible consumer product safety standard under this chapter would adequately protect the public from the unreasonable risk of injury associated with such product;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) in the case of a rule which relates to a risk of injury with respect to which persons who would be subject to such rule have adopted and implemented a voluntary consumer product safety standard, that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) compliance with such voluntary consumer product safety standard is not likely to result in the elimination or adequate reduction of such risk of injury; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) it is unlikely that there will be substantial compliance with such voluntary consumer product safety standard;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) that the benefits expected from the rule bear a reasonable relationship to its costs; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) that the rule imposes the least burdensome requirement which prevents or adequately reduces the risk of injury for which the rule is being promulgated.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) Any preliminary or final regulatory analysis prepared under subsection (c) or (f)(2) shall not be subject to independent judicial review, except that when an action for judicial review of a rule is instituted, the contents of any such regulatory analysis shall constitute part of the whole rulemaking record of agency action in connection with such review.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The provisions of subparagraph (A) shall not be construed to alter the substantive or procedural standards otherwise applicable to judicial review of any action by the Commission.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Effective date of rule or standard; stockpiling of product</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Each consumer product safety rule shall specify the date such rule is to take effect not exceeding 180 days from the date promulgated, unless the Commission finds, for good cause shown, that a later effective date is in the public interest and publishes its reasons for such finding. The effective date of a consumer product safety standard under this chapter shall be set at a date at least 30 days after the date of promulgation unless the Commission for good cause shown determines that an earlier effective date is in the public interest. In no case may the effective date be set at a date which is earlier than the date of promulgation. A consumer product safety standard shall be applicable only to consumer products manufactured after the effective date.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission may by rule prohibit a manufacturer of a consumer product from stockpiling any product to which a consumer product safety rule applies, or to which a rule under this chapter or similar rule, regulation, standard, or ban under any other Act enforced by the Commission applies, so as to prevent such manufacturer from circumventing the purpose of such rule, regulation, standard, or ban. For purposes of this paragraph, the term &quot;stockpiling&quot; means manufacturing or importing a product between the date of promulgation of such rule, regulation, standard, or ban and its effective date at a rate which is significantly greater (as determined under the rule under this paragraph) than the rate at which such product was produced or imported during a base period (prescribed in the rule under this paragraph) ending before the date of promulgation of the rule, regulation, standard, or ban.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Amendment or revocation of rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission may by rule amend or revoke any consumer product safety rule. Such amendment or revocation shall specify the date on which it is to take effect which shall not exceed 180 days from the date the amendment or revocation is published unless the Commission finds for good cause shown that a later effective date is in the public interest and publishes its reasons for such finding. Where an amendment involves a material change in a consumer product safety rule, sections 2056 and 2057 of this title, and subsections (a) through (g) of this section shall apply. In order to revoke a consumer product safety rule, the Commission shall publish a proposal to revoke such rule in the Federal Register, and allow oral and written presentations in accordance with subsection (d)(2) of this section. It may revoke such rule only if it determines that the rule is not reasonably necessary to eliminate or reduce an unreasonable risk of injury associated with the product. Section 2060 of this title shall apply to any amendment of a consumer product safety rule which involves a material change and to any revocation of a consumer product safety rule, in the same manner and to the same extent as such section applies to the Commission's action in promulgating such a rule.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Petition to initiate rulemaking</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall grant, in whole or in part, or deny any petition under section 553(e) of title 5 requesting the Commission to initiate a rulemaking, within a reasonable time after the date on which such petition is filed. The Commission shall state the reasons for granting or denying such petition. The Commission may not deny any such petition on the basis of a voluntary standard unless the voluntary standard is in existence at the time of the denial of the petition, the Commission has determined that the voluntary standard is likely to result in the elimination or adequate reduction of the risk of injury identified in the petition, and it is likely that there will be substantial compliance with the standard.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2060. Judicial review of consumer product safety rules</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Petition by persons adversely affected, consumers, or consumer organizations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not later than 60 days after a consumer product safety rule is promulgated by the Commission, any person adversely affected by such rule, or any consumer or consumer organization, may file a petition with the United States court of appeals for the District of Columbia, or for the circuit in which such person, consumer, or organization resides or has his principal place of business for judicial review of such rule. Copies of the petition shall be forthwith transmitted by the clerk of the court to the Commission or other officer designated by it for that purpose and to the Attorney General. The record of the proceedings on which the Commission based its rule shall be filed in the court as provided for in section 2112 of title 28. For purposes of this section, the term &quot;record&quot; means such consumer product safety rule; any notice or proposal published pursuant to section 2056, 2057, or 2058 of this title; the transcript required by section 2058(d)(2) of this title of any oral presentation; any written submission of interested parties; and any other information which the Commission considers relevant to such rule.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Additional data, views, or arguments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the petitioner applies to the court for leave to adduce additional data, views, or arguments and shows to the satisfaction of the court that such additional data, views, or arguments are material and that there were reasonable grounds for the petitioner's failure to adduce such data, views, or arguments in the proceeding before the Commission, the court may order the Commission to provide additional opportunity for the oral presentation of data, views, or arguments and for written submissions. The Commission may modify its findings, or make new findings by reason of the additional data, views, or arguments so taken and shall file such modified or new findings, and its recommendation, if any, for the modification or setting aside of its original rule, with the return of such additional data, views, or arguments.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Jurisdiction; costs and attorneys&apos; fees; substantial evidence to support administrative findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon the filing of the petition under subsection (a) of this section the court shall have jurisdiction to review the consumer product safety rule in accordance with chapter 7 of title 5, and to grant appropriate relief, including interim relief, as provided in such chapter. A court may in the interest of justice include in such relief an award of the costs of suit, including reasonable attorneys&apos; fees (determined in accordance with subsection (f)&#160;<sup><a href="#2060_1_target" name="2060_1">1</a></sup> and reasonable expert witnesses&apos; fees. Attorneys&apos; fees may be awarded against the United States (or any agency or official of the United States) without regard to section 2412 of title 28 or any other provision of law. The consumer product safety rule shall not be affirmed unless the Commission's findings under sections 2058(f)(1) and 2058(f)(3) of this title are supported by substantial evidence on the record taken as a whole.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Supreme Court review</h4>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Filing of action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission may file in a United States district court an action (1) against an imminently hazardous consumer product for seizure of such product under subsection (b)(2), or (2) against any person who is a manufacturer, distributor, or retailer of such product, or (3) against both. Such an action may be filed notwithstanding the existence of a consumer product safety rule applicable to such product, or the pendency of any administrative or judicial proceedings under any other provision of this chapter. As used in this section, and hereinafter in this chapter, the term &quot;imminently hazardous consumer product&quot; means a consumer product which presents imminent and unreasonable risk of death, serious illness, or severe personal injury.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Relief; product condemnation and seizure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The district court in which such action is filed shall have jurisdiction to declare such product an imminently hazardous consumer product, and (in the case of an action under subsection (a)(2) of this section) to grant (as ancillary to such declaration or in lieu thereof) such temporary or permanent relief as may be necessary to protect the public from such risk. Such relief may include a mandatory order requiring the notification of such risk to purchasers of such product known to the defendant, public notice, the recall, the repair or the replacement of, or refund for, such product.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In the case of an action under subsection (a)(1) of this section, the consumer product may be proceeded against by process of libel for the seizure and condemnation of such product in any United States district court within the jurisdiction of which such consumer product is found. Proceedings and cases instituted under the authority of the preceding sentence shall conform as nearly as possible to proceedings in rem in admiralty.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Consumer product safety rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Where appropriate, concurrently with the filing of such action or as soon thereafter as may be practicable, the Commission shall initiate a proceeding to promulgate a consumer product safety rule applicable to the consumer product with respect to which such action is filed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Jurisdiction and venue; process; subpena</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) An action under subsection (a)(2) of this section may be brought in the United States district court for the District of Columbia or in any judicial district in which any of the defendants is found, is an inhabitant or transacts business; and process in such an action may be served on a defendant in any other district in which such defendant resides or may be found. Subpenas requiring attendance of witnesses in such an action may run into any other district. In determining the judicial district in which an action may be brought under this section in instances in which such action may be brought in more than one judicial district, the Commission shall take into account the convenience of the parties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Whenever proceedings under this section involving substantially similar consumer products are pending in courts in two or more judicial districts, they shall be consolidated for trial by order of any such court upon application reasonably made by any party in interest, upon notice to all other parties in interest.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1735 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Employment of attorneys by Commission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in any action under this section, the Commission may direct attorneys employed by it to appear and represent it.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">Not later than 60 days after August 12, 2011, the Commission shall seek public comment on opportunities to reduce the cost of third party testing requirements consistent with assuring compliance with any applicable consumer product safety rule, ban, standard, or regulation. The request for public comment shall include the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) The extent to which the use of materials subject to regulations of another government agency that requires third party testing of those materials may provide sufficient assurance of conformity with an applicable consumer product safety rule, ban, standard, or regulation without further third party testing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) The extent to which modification of the certification requirements may have the effect of reducing redundant third party testing by or on behalf of 2 or more importers of a product that is substantially similar or identical in all material respects.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) The extent to which products with a substantial number of different components subject to third party testing may be evaluated to show compliance with an applicable rule, ban, standard, or regulation by third party testing of a subset of such components selected by a third party conformity assessment body.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) The extent to which manufacturers with a substantial number of substantially similar products subject to third party testing may reasonably make use of sampling procedures that reduce the overall test burden without compromising the benefits of third party testing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) The extent to which evidence of conformity with other national or international governmental standards may provide assurance of conformity to consumer product safety rules, bans, standards, or regulations applicable under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vi) The extent to which technology, other than the technology already approved by the Commission, exists for third party conformity assessment bodies to test or to screen for testing consumer products subject to a third party testing requirement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vii) Other techniques for lowering the cost of third party testing consistent with assuring compliance with the applicable consumer product safety rules, bans, standards, and regulations.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Following the public comment period described in subparagraph (A), but not later than 1 year after August 12, 2011, the Commission shall review the public comments and may prescribe new or revised third party testing regulations if it determines that such regulations will reduce third party testing costs consistent with assuring compliance with the applicable consumer product safety rules, bans, standards, and regulations.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the Commission determines that it lacks authority to implement an opportunity for reducing the costs of third-party testing consistent with assuring compliance with the applicable consumer product safety rules, bans, standards, and regulations, it shall transmit a report to Congress reviewing those opportunities, along with any recommendations for any legislation to permit such implementation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">In lieu of or as part of any alternative testing requirements provided under clause (i), the Commission may allow certification of a product to an applicable consumer product safety rule, ban, standard, or regulation, or portion thereof, based on documentation that the product complies with another national or international governmental standard or safety requirement that the Commission determines is the same or more stringent than the consumer product safety rule, ban, standard, or regulation, or portion thereof. Any such certification shall only be allowed to the extent of the equivalency with a consumer product safety rule, ban, standard, or regulation and not to any other part of the consumer product safety rule, ban, standard, or regulation.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iv) Restriction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Except as provided in subparagraph (C), and except where the Commission determines that the manufacturer does not meet the definition of a small batch manufacturer, for any small batch manufacturer registered pursuant to subparagraph (B), the Commission may not require third party testing of a covered product by a third party conformity assessment body until the Commission has provided either an alternative testing requirement or an exemption in accordance with clause (i) or (ii), respectively.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Repair; replacement; refunds; action plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If the Commission determines (after affording interested parties, including consumers and consumer organizations, an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with subsection (f)) that a product distributed in commerce presents a substantial product hazard and that action under this subsection is in the public interest, it may order the manufacturer or any distributor or retailer of such product to provide the notice required by subsection (c) and to take any one or more of the following actions it determines to be in the public interest:</p>

The Commission shall specify in the order the persons to whom refunds must be made if the Commission orders the action described in subparagraph (C).<sup><a href="#2064_2_target" name="2064_2">2</a></sup> An order under this subsection may prohibit the person to whom it applies from manufacturing for sale, offering for sale, distributing in commerce, or importing into the customs territory of the United States (as defined in general note 2 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States), or from doing any combination of such actions, the product with respect to which the order was issued.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) If the Commission approves an action plan, it shall indicate its approval in writing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the Commission finds that an approved action plan is not effective or appropriate under the circumstances, or that the manufacturer, retailer, or distributor is not executing an approved action plan effectively, the Commission may, by order, amend, or require amendment of, the action plan. In determining whether an approved plan is effective or appropriate under the circumstances, the Commission shall consider whether a repair or replacement changes the intended functionality of the product.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) If the Commission determines, after notice and opportunity for comment, that a manufacturer, retailer, or distributor has failed to comply substantially with its obligations under its action plan, the Commission may revoke its approval of the action plan. The manufacturer, retailer, or distributor to which the action plan applies may not distribute in commerce the product to which the action plan relates after receipt of notice of a revocation of the action plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Reimbursement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) No charge shall be made to any person (other than a manufacturer, distributor, or retailer) who avails himself of any remedy provided under an order issued under subsection (d), and the person subject to the order shall reimburse each person (other than a manufacturer, distributor, or retailer) who is entitled to such a remedy for any reasonable and foreseeable expenses incurred by such person in availing himself of such remedy.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An order issued under subsection (c) or (d) with respect to a product may require any person who is a manufacturer, distributor, or retailer of the product to reimburse any other person who is a manufacturer, distributor, or retailer of such product for such other person's expenses in connection with carrying out the order, if the Commission determines such reimbursement to be in the public interest.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Hearing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), an order under subsection (c) or (d) may be issued <!-- PDFPage:1743 -->only after an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with section 554 of title 5 except that, if the Commission determines that any person who wishes to participate in such hearing is a part of a class of participants who share an identity of interest, the Commission may limit such person's participation in such hearing to participation through a single representative designated by such class (or by the Commission if such class fails to designate such a representative). Any settlement offer which is submitted to the presiding officer at a hearing under this subsection shall be transmitted by the officer to the Commission for its consideration unless the settlement offer is clearly frivolous or duplicative of offers previously made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The requirement for a hearing in paragraph (1) shall not apply to an order issued under subsection (c) or (d) relating to an imminently hazardous consumer product with regard to which the Commission has filed an action under section 2061 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Preliminary injunction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If the Commission has initiated a proceeding under this section for the issuance of an order under subsection (d) with respect to a product which the Commission has reason to believe presents a substantial product hazard, the Commission (without regard to section 2076(b)(7) of this title) or the Attorney General may, in accordance with 2061(d)(1)&#160;<sup><a href="#2064_3_target" name="2064_3">3</a></sup> of this title, apply to a district court of the United States for the issuance of a preliminary injunction to restrain the distribution in commerce of such product pending the completion of such proceeding. If such a preliminary injunction has been issued, the Commission (or the Attorney General if the preliminary injunction was issued upon an application of the Attorney General) may apply to the issuing court for extensions of such preliminary injunction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any preliminary injunction, and any extension of a preliminary injunction, issued under this subsection with respect to a product shall be in effect for such period as the issuing court prescribes not to exceed a period which extends beyond the thirtieth day from the date of the issuance of the preliminary injunction (or, in the case of a preliminary injunction which has been extended, the date of its extension) or the date of the completion or termination of the proceeding under this section respecting such product, whichever date occurs first.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The amount in controversy requirement of section 1331 of title 28 does not apply with respect to the jurisdiction of a district court of the United States to issue or exend&#160;<sup><a href="#2064_4_target" name="2064_4">4</a></sup> a preliminary injunction under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Cost-benefit analysis of notification or other action not required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section shall be construed to require the Commission, in determining that a product distributed in commerce presents a substantial product hazard and that notification or other action under this section should be taken, to prepare a comparison of the costs that would be incurred in providing notification or taking other action under this section with the benefits from such notification or action.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Requirements for recall notices</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) Other information the Commission deems appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Substantial product hazard list</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission may specify, by rule, for any consumer product or class of consumer <!-- PDFPage:1744 -->products, characteristics whose existence or absence shall be deemed a substantial product hazard under subsection (a)(2), if the Commission determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) such characteristics are readily observable and have been addressed by voluntary standards; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such standards have been effective in reducing the risk of injury from consumer products and that there is substantial compliance with such standards.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Judicial review</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Refusal of admission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any consumer product offered for importation into the customs territory of the United States (as defined in general note 2 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States) shall be refused admission into such customs territory if such product&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) fails to comply with an applicable consumer product safety rule;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) is not accompanied by a certificate required by this chapter or any other Act enforced by the Commission, or is accompanied by a false certificate, if the manufacturer in the exercise of due care has reason to know that the certificate is false or misleading in any material respect, or is not accompanied by any label or certificate (including tracking labels) required under section 2063 of this title or any rule or regulation under such section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) is or has been determined to be an imminently hazardous consumer product in a proceeding brought under section 2061 of this title;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) is a product which was manufactured by a person who the Commission has informed the Secretary of the Treasury is in violation of subsection (g).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Samples</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of the Treasury shall obtain without charge and deliver to the Commission, upon the latter's request, a reasonable number of samples of consumer products being offered for import. Except for those owners or consignees who are or have been afforded an opportunity for a hearing in a proceeding under section 2061 of this title with respect to an imminently hazardous product, the owner or consignee of the product shall be afforded an opportunity by the Commission for a hearing in accordance with section 554 of title 5 with respect to the importation of such products into the customs territory of the United States. If it appears from examination of such samples or otherwise that a product must be refused admission under the terms of subsection (a), such product shall be refused admission, unless subsection (c) of this section applies and is complied with.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Modification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If it appears to the Commission that any consumer product which may be refused admission pursuant to subsection (a) of this section can be so modified that it need not (under the terms of paragraphs (1) through (4) of subsection (a)) be refused admission, the Commission may defer final determination as to the admission of such product and, in accordance with such regulations as the Commission and the Secretary of the Treasury shall jointly agree to, permit such product to be delivered from customs custody under bond for the purpose of permitting the owner or consignee an opportunity to so modify such product.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Supervision of modifications</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">All actions taken by an owner or consignee to modify such product under subsection (c) shall be subject to the supervision of an officer or employee of the Commission and of the Department of the Treasury. If it appears to the Commission that the product cannot be so modified or that the owner or consignee is not proceeding satisfactorily to modify such product, it shall be refused admission into the customs territory of the United States, and the Commission may direct the Secretary to demand redelivery of the product into customs custody, and to seize the product in accordance with section 2071(b) of this title if it is not so redelivered.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Product destruction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Products refused admission into the customs territory of the United States shall be destroyed unless, upon application by the owner, consignee, or importer of record, the Secretary of the Treasury permits the export of the product in lieu of destruction. If the owner, consignee, or importer of record does not export the product within 90 days of approval to export, such product shall be destroyed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Payment of expenses occasioned by refusal of admission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">All expenses (including travel, per diem or subsistence, and salaries of officers or employees <!-- PDFPage:1747 -->of the United States) in connection with the destruction provided for in this section (the amount of such expenses to be determined in accordance with regulations of the Secretary of the Treasury) and all expenses in connection with the storage, cartage, or labor with respect to any consumer product refused admission under this section, shall be paid by the owner or consignee and, in default of such payment, shall constitute a lien against any future importations made by such owner or consignee.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Inspection and recordkeeping requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Manufacturers of imported products shall be in compliance with all inspection and recordkeeping requirements under section 2065 of this title applicable to such products, and the Commission shall advise the Secretary of the Treasury of any manufacturer who is not in compliance with all inspection and recordkeeping requirements under section 2065 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Product surveillance program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Commission shall establish and maintain a permanent product surveillance program, in cooperation with other appropriate Federal agencies, for the purpose of carrying out the Commission's responsibilities under this chapter and the other Acts administered by the Commission and preventing the entry of unsafe consumer products into the commerce of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission may provide to the agencies with which it is cooperating under paragraph (1) such information, data, violator lists, test results, and other support, guidance, and documents as may be necessary or helpful for such agencies to cooperate with the Commission to carry out the product surveillance program under paragraph (1).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">This chapter shall not apply to any consumer product if (1) it can be shown that such product is manufactured, sold, or held for sale for export from the United States (or that such product was imported for export), unless (A) such consumer product is in fact distributed in commerce for use in the United States, or (B) the Commission determines that exportation of such product presents an unreasonable risk of injury to consumers within the United States, and (2) such consumer product when distributed in commerce, or any container in which it is enclosed when so distributed, bears a stamp or label stating that such consumer product is intended for export; except that this chapter shall apply to any consumer product manufactured for sale, offered for sale, or sold for shipment to any installation of the United States located outside of the United States.</p>

Any statement filed with the Commission under the preceding sentence shall specify the anticipated date of shipment of such product, the country and port of destination of such product, and the quantity of such product that will be exported, and shall contain such other information as the Commission may by regulation require. Upon petition filed with the Commission by any person required to file a statement under this subsection respecting an exportation, the Commission may, for good cause shown, exempt such person from the requirement of this subsection that such a statement be filed no less than thirty days before the date of the exportation, except that in no case shall the Commission permit such a statement to be filed later than the tenth day before such date.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Authority to prohibit exports</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission may prohibit a person from exporting from the United States for purpose of sale any consumer product that is not in con<!-- PDFPage:1750 -->formity with an applicable consumer product safety rule under this chapter, unless the importing country has notified the Commission that such country accepts the importation of such consumer product, provided that if the importing country has not so notified the Commission within 30 days after the Commission has provided notice to the importing country of the impending shipment, the Commission may take such action as appropriate within its authority with respect to the disposition of the product under the circumstances.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Export pursuant to section 2066(e)</h4>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Amount of penalty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any person who knowingly violates section 2068 of this title shall be subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $100,000 for each such violation. Subject to paragraph (2), a violation of section 2068(a)(1), (2), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9), (10), or (11) of this title shall constitute a separate offense with respect to each consumer product involved, except that the maximum civil penalty shall not exceed $15,000,000 for any related series of violations. A violation of section 2068(a)(3) of this title shall constitute a separate violation with respect to each failure or refusal to allow or perform an act required thereby; and, if such violation is a continuing one, each day of such violation shall constitute a separate offense, except that the maximum civil penalty shall not exceed $15,000,000 for any related series of violations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The second sentence of paragraph (1) of this subsection shall not apply to violations of paragraph (1) or (2) of section 2068(a) of this title&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) if the person who violated such paragraphs is not the manufacturer or private la<!-- PDFPage:1752 -->beler or a distributor of the products involved, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if such person did not have either (i) actual knowledge that his distribution or sale of the product violated such paragraphs or (ii) notice from the Commission that such distribution or sale would be a violation of such paragraphs.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) The maximum penalty amounts authorized in paragraph (1) shall be adjusted for inflation as provided in this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Not later than December 1, 2011, and December 1 of each fifth calendar year thereafter, the Commission shall prescribe and publish in the Federal Register a schedule of maximum authorized penalties that shall apply for violations that occur after January 1 of the year immediately following such publication.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The schedule of maximum authorized penalties shall be prescribed by increasing each of the amounts referred to in paragraph (1) by the cost-of-living adjustment for the preceding five years. Any increase determined under the preceding sentence shall be rounded to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) in the case of penalties greater than $1,000 but less than or equal to $10,000, the nearest multiple of $1,000;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) in the case of penalties greater than $10,000 but less than or equal to $100,000, the nearest multiple of $5,000;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) in the case of penalties greater than $100,000 but less than or equal to $200,000, the nearest multiple of $10,000; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) in the case of penalties greater than $200,000, the nearest multiple of $25,000.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(D) For purposes of this subsection:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) The term &quot;Consumer Price Index&quot; means the Consumer Price Index for all-urban consumers published by the Department of Labor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) The term &quot;cost-of-living adjustment for the preceding five years&quot; means the percentage by which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) the Consumer Price Index for the month of June of the calendar year preceding the adjustment; exceeds</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) the Consumer Price Index for the month of June preceding the date on which the maximum authorized penalty was last adjusted.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Relevant factors in determining amount of penalty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In determining the amount of any penalty to be sought upon commencing an action seeking to assess a penalty for a violation of section 2068(a) of this title, the Commission shall consider the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation, including the nature of the product defect, the severity of the risk of injury, the occurrence or absence of injury, the number of defective products distributed, the appropriateness of such penalty in relation to the size of the business of the person charged, including how to mitigate undue adverse economic impacts on small businesses, and such other factors as appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Compromise of penalty; deductions from penalty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any civil penalty under this section may be compromised by the Commission. In determining the amount of such penalty or whether it should be remitted or mitigated and in what amount, the Commission shall consider the appropriateness of such penalty to the size of the business of the person charged, including how to mitigate undue adverse economic impacts on small businesses, the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation, including,<sup><a href="#2069_1_target" name="2069_1">1</a></sup> the nature of the product defect, the severity of the risk of injury, the occurrence or absence of injury, and the number of defective products distributed, and such other factors as appropriate. The amount of such penalty when finally determined, or the amount agreed on compromise, may be deducted from any sums owing by the United States to the person charged.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) &quot;Knowingly&quot; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As used in the first sentence of subsection (a)(1) of this section, the term &quot;knowingly&quot; means (1) the having of actual knowledge, or (2) the presumed having of knowledge deemed to be possessed by a reasonable man who acts in the circumstances, including knowledge obtainable upon the exercise of due care to ascertain the truth of representations.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) State compliance to Federal standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever a consumer product safety standard under this chapter is in effect and applies to a risk of injury associated with a consumer product, no State or political subdivision of a State shall have any authority either to establish or to continue in effect any provision of a safety standard or regulation which prescribes any requirements as to the performance, composition, contents, design, finish, construction, packaging, or labeling of such product which are designed to deal with the same risk of injury associated with such consumer product, unless such requirements are identical to the requirements of the Federal standard.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Consumer product safety requirements which impose performance standards more stringent than Federal standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subsection (a) of this section does not prevent the Federal Government or the government of any State or political subdivision of a State from establishing or continuing in effect a safety requirement applicable to a consumer product for its own use which requirement is designed to protect against a risk of injury associated with the product and which is not identical to the consumer product safety standard applicable to the product under this chapter if the Federal, State, or political subdivision requirement provides a higher degree of protection from such risk of injury than the standard applicable under this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Exemptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon application of a State or political subdivision of a State, the Commission may by rule, after notice and opportunity for oral presentation of views, exempt from the provisions of subsection (a) (under such conditions as it may impose in the rule) any proposed safety standard or regulation which is described in such application and which is designed to protect against a risk of injury associated with a consumer product subject to a consumer product safety standard under this chapter if the State or political subdivision standard or regulation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) provides a significantly higher degree of protection from such risk of injury than the consumer product safety standard under this chapter, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) does not unduly burden interstate commerce.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">In determining the burden, if any, of a State or political subdivision standard or regulation on interstate commerce, the Commission shall consider and make appropriate (as determined by the Commission in its discretion) findings on the technological and economic feasibility of complying with such standard or regulation, the cost of complying with such standard or regulation, the geographic distribution of the consumer product to which the standard or regulation would apply, the probability of other States or political subdivisions applying for an exemption under this subsection for a similar standard or regulation, and the need for a national, uniform standard under this chapter for such consumer product.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) a law administered by the Commission, if disclosure of the material would further a Commission investigation or enforcement proceeding; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) with respect to a foreign law enforcement agency, with the approval of the Attorney General, other foreign criminal laws, if such foreign criminal laws are offenses defined in or covered by a criminal mutual legal assistance treaty in force between the government of the United States and the foreign law enforcement agency's government; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Abrogation of agreements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission may abrogate any agreement or memorandum of understanding with <!-- PDFPage:1763 -->another agency if the Commission determines that the other agency has failed to maintain in confidence any information provided under such agreement or memorandum of understanding, or has used any such information for purposes other than those set forth in such agreement or memorandum of understanding.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Additional rules against disclosure</h4>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2082. Interim cellulose insulation safety standard</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Applicability of specification of General Services Administration; authority and effect of interim standard; modifications; criteria; labeling requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (2), on and after the last day of the 60-day period beginning on July 11, 1978, the requirements for flame resistance and corrosiveness set forth in the General Services Administration's specification for cellulose insulation, HH&ndash;I&ndash;515C (as such specification was in effect on February 1, 1978), shall be deemed to be an interim consumer product safety standard which shall have all the authority and effect of any other consumer product safety standard promulgated by the Commission under this chapter. During the 45-day period beginning on July 11, 1978, the Commission may make, and shall publish in the Federal Register, such technical, nonsubstantive changes in such requirements as it deems appropriate to make such requirements suitable for promulgation as a consumer product safety standard. At the end of the 60-day period specified in the first sentence of this paragraph, the Commission shall publish in the Federal Register such interim consumer product safety standard, as altered by the Commission under this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The interim consumer product safety standard established in paragraph (1) shall provide that any cellulose insulation which is produced or distributed for sale or use as a consumer product shall have a flame spread rating of 0 to 25, as such rating is set forth in the General Services Administration's specification for cellulose insulation, HH&ndash;I&ndash;515C.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) During the period for which the interim consumer product safety standard established in subsection (a) is in effect, in addition to complying with any labeling requirement established by the Commission under this chapter, each manufacturer or private labeler of cellulose insulation shall include the following statement on any container of such cellulose insulation: &quot;ATTENTION: This material meets the applicable minimum Federal flammability standard. This standard is based upon laboratory tests only, which do not represent actual conditions which may occur in the home&quot;. Such statement shall be located in a conspicuous place on such container and shall appear in conspicuous and legible type in contrast by typography, layout, and color with other printed matter on such container.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Scope of judicial review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Judicial review of the interim consumer product safety standard established in subsection (a), as such standard is in effect on and after the last day of the 60-day period specified in such subsection, shall be limited solely to the issue of whether any changes made by the Commission under paragraph (1) are technical, nonsubstantive changes. For purposes of such review, any change made by the Commission under paragraph (1) which requires that any test to determine the flame spread rating of cellulose insulation shall include a correction for variations in test results caused by equipment used in the test shall be considered a technical, nonsubstantive change.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Enforcement; violations; promulgation of final standard; procedures applicable to promulgation; revision of interim standard; procedures applicable to revision</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) Any interim consumer product safety standard established pursuant to this section shall be enforced in the same manner as any other consumer product safety standard until such time as there is in effect a final consumer product safety standard promulgated by the Commission, as provided in subparagraph (B), or until such time as it is revoked by the Commission under section 2058(e) of this title. A violation of the interim consumer product safety standard shall be deemed to be a violation of a consumer product safety standard promulgated by the Commission under section 2058 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the Commission determines that the interim consumer product safety standard does not adequately protect the public from the unreasonable risk of injury associated with flammable or corrosive cellulose insulation, it shall promulgate a final consumer product safety standard to protect against such risk. Such final standard shall be promulgated pursuant to section 553 of title 5, except that the Commission shall give interested persons an opportunity for the oral presentation of data, views, or arguments, in addition to an opportunity to make written submissions. A transcript shall be kept of any oral presentation. The provisions of section 2058(b), (c), and (d) of this title shall apply to any proceeding to promulgate such final standard. In any judicial review of such final standard under section 2060 of this title, the court shall not require any demonstration that each particular finding made by the Commission under section 2058(c) of this title is supported by substantial evidence. The court shall affirm the action of the Commission unless the court determines that such action is not supported by substantial evidence on the record taken as a whole.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1768 --><p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Until there is in effect such a final consumer product safety standard, the Commission shall incorporate into the interim consumer product safety standard, in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph, each revision superseding the requirements for flame resistance and corrosiveness referred to in subsection (a) and promulgated by the General Services Administration.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) At least 45 days before any revision superseding such requirements is to become effective, the Administrator of the General Services Administration shall notify the Commission of such revision. In the case of any such revision which becomes effective during the period beginning on February 1, 1978, and ending on July 11, 1978, such notice from the Administrator of the General Services Administration shall be deemed to have been made on July 11, 1978.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C)(i) No later than 45 days after receiving any notice under subparagraph (B), the Commission shall publish the revision, including such changes in the revision as it considers appropriate to make the revision suitable for promulgation as an amendment to the interim consumer product safety standard, in the Federal Register as a proposed amendment to the interim consumer product safety standard.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) The Commission may extend the 45-day period specified in clause (i) for an additional period of not more than 150 days if the Commission determines that such extension is necessary to study the technical and scientific basis for the revision involved, or to study the safety and economic consequences of such revision.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D)(i) Additional extensions of the 45-day period specified in subparagraph (C)(i) may be taken by the Commission if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) the Commission makes the determination required in subparagraph (C)(ii) with respect to each such extension; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) in the case of further extensions proposed by the Commission after an initial extension under this clause, such further extensions have not been disapproved under clause (iv).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) Any extension made by the Commission under this subparagraph shall be for a period of not more than 45 days.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) Prior notice of each extension made by the Commission under this subparagraph, together with a statement of the reasons for such extension and an estimate of the length of time required by the Commission to complete its action upon the revision involved, shall be published in the Federal Register and shall be submitted to the appropriate Congressional committees.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iv) In any case in which the Commission takes an initial 45-day extension under clause (i), the Commission may not take any further extensions under clause (i) if each committee referred to in clause (iii) disapproves by committee resolution any such further extensions before the end of the 15-day period following notice of such initial extension made by the Commission in accordance with clause (iii).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(E) The Commission shall give interested persons an opportunity to comment upon any proposed amendment to the interim consumer product safety standard during the 30-day period following any publication by the Commission under subparagraph (C).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(F) No later than 90 days after the end of the period specified in subparagraph (E), the Commission shall promulgate the amendment to the interim consumer product safety standard unless the Commission determines, after consultation with the Secretary of Energy, that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) such amendment is not necessary for the protection of consumers from the unreasonable risk of injury associated with flammable or corrosive cellulose insulation; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) implementation of such amendment will create an undue burden upon persons who are subject to the interim consumer product safety standard.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(G) The provisions of section 2060 of this title shall not apply to any judicial review of any amendment to the interim product safety standard promulgated under this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Reporting requirements of other Federal departments, agencies, etc., of violations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any Federal department, agency, or instrumentality, or any Federal independent regulatory agency, which obtains information which reasonably indicates that cellulose insulation is being manufactured or distributed in violation of this chapter shall immediately inform the Commission of such information.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Reporting requirements of Commission to Congressional committees; contents, time of submission, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Commission, no later than 45 days after July 11, 1978, shall submit a report to the appropriate Congressional committees which shall contain a detailed statement of the manner in which the Commission intends to carry out the enforcement of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) A person who believes that he or she has been discharged or otherwise discriminated against by any person in violation of subsection (a) may, not later than 180 days after the date on which such violation occurs, file (or have any person file on his or her behalf) a complaint with the Secretary of Labor alleging such discharge or discrimination and identifying the person responsible for such act. Upon receipt of such a complaint, the Secretary shall notify, in writing, the person named in the complaint of the filing of the complaint, of the allegations contained in the complaint, of the substance of evidence supporting the complaint, and of the opportunities that will be afforded to such person under paragraph (2).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Not later than 60 days after the date of receipt of a complaint filed under paragraph (1) and after affording the complainant and the person named in the complaint an opportunity to submit to the Secretary a written response to the complaint and an opportunity to meet with a representative of the Secretary to present statements from witnesses, the Secretary shall initiate an investigation and determine whether there is reasonable cause to believe that the complaint has merit and notify, in writing, the complainant and the person alleged to have committed a violation of subsection (a) of the Secretary's findings.
