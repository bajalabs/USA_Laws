<p class="note-body">Space Policy Directive&ndash;4, Feb. 19, 2019, 84 F.R. 6049, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum for the Vice President[,] the Secretary of State[,] the Secretary of Defense[,] the Secretary of Commerce[,] the Secretary of Labor[,] the Secretary of Transportation[,] the Secretary of Homeland Security[,] the Director of the Office of Management and Budget[,] the Director of National Intelligence[,] the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs[,] the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy[,] the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff[,] the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration[, and] the Deputy Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <i>Introduction</i>. Space is integral to our way of life, our national security, and modern warfare. Although United States space systems have historically maintained a technological advantage over those of our potential adversaries, those potential adversaries are now advancing their space capabilities and actively developing ways to deny our use of space in a crisis or conflict. It is imperative that the United States adapt its national security organizations, policies, doctrine, and capabilities to deter aggression and protect our interests. Toward that end, the Department of Defense shall take actions under existing authority to marshal its space resources to deter and counter threats in space, and to develop a legislative proposal to establish a United States Space Force as a sixth branch of the United States Armed Forces within the Department of the Air Force. This is an important step toward a future military department for space. Under this proposal, the United States Space Force would be authorized to organize, train, and equip military space forces of the United States to ensure unfettered access to, and freedom to operate in, space, and to provide vital capabilities to joint and coalition forces in peacetime and across the spectrum of conflict.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <i>Definitions</i>. For the purposes of this memorandum and the legislative proposal directed by section <!-- PDFPage:3460 -->3 of this memorandum, the following definitions shall apply:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) The term &quot;United States Space Force&quot; refers to a new branch of the United States Armed Forces to be initially placed by statute within the Department of the Air Force.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The term &quot;Department of the Space Force&quot; refers to a future military department within the Department of Defense that will be responsible for organizing, training, and equipping the United States Space Force.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) The term &quot;United States Space Command&quot; refers to a Unified Combatant Command to be established pursuant to the Presidential memorandum of December 18, 2018 (Establishment of United States Space Command as a Unified Combatant Command) [10 U.S.C. 161 note], that will be responsible for Joint Force space operations as will be assigned in the Unified Command Plan.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <i>Legislative Proposal and Purpose</i>. The Secretary of Defense shall submit a legislative proposal to the President through the Office of Management and Budget that would establish the United States Space Force as a new armed service within the Department of the Air Force.</p>
<p class="note-body">The legislative proposal would, if enacted, establish the United States Space Force to organize, train, and equip forces to provide for freedom of operation in, from, and to the space domain; to provide independent military options for national leadership; and to enhance the lethality and effectiveness of the Joint Force. The United States Space Force should include both combat and combat support functions to enable prompt and sustained offensive and defensive space operations, and joint operations in all domains. The United States Space Force shall be organized, trained, and equipped to meet the following priorities:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) Protecting the Nation's interests in space and the peaceful use of space for all responsible actors, consistent with applicable law, including international law;</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Ensuring unfettered use of space for United States national security purposes, the United States economy, and United States persons, partners, and allies;</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Deterring aggression and defending the Nation, United States allies, and United States interests from hostile acts in and from space;</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) Ensuring that needed space capabilities are integrated and available to all United States Combatant Commands;</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) Projecting military power in, from, and to space in support of our Nation's interests; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(f) Developing, maintaining, and improving a community of professionals focused on the national security demands of the space domain.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <i>Scope</i>. (a) The legislative proposal required by section 3 of this memorandum shall, in addition to the provisions required under section 3 of this memorandum, include provisions that would, if enacted:</p>
<p class="note-body">(i) consolidate existing forces and authorities for military space activities, as appropriate, in order to minimize duplication of effort and eliminate bureaucratic inefficiencies; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(ii) not include the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the National Reconnaissance Office, or other non-military space organizations or missions of the United States Government.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The proposed United States Space Force should:</p>
<p class="note-body">(i) include, as determined by the Secretary of Defense in consultation with the Secretaries of the military departments, the uniformed and civilian personnel conducting and directly supporting space operations from all Department of Defense Armed Forces;</p>
<p class="note-body">(ii) assume responsibilities for all major military space acquisition programs; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(iii) create the appropriate career tracks for military and civilian space personnel across all relevant specialties, including operations, intelligence, engineering, science, acquisition, and cyber.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. <i>United States Space Force Budget</i>. In accordance with the Department of Defense budget process, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget a proposed budget for the United States Space Force to be included in the President's Fiscal Year 2020 Budget Request.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 6. <i>United States Space Force Organization and Leadership</i>. (a) The legislative proposal required by section 3 of this memorandum shall create a civilian Under Secretary of the Air Force for Space, to be known as the Under Secretary for Space, appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The legislative proposal shall establish a Chief of Staff of the Space Force, who will be a senior military officer in the grade of General or Admiral, and who shall serve as a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 7. <i>Associated Elements</i>. (a) A Unified Combatant Command for space, to be known as the United States Space Command, will be established consistent with law, as directed on December 18, 2018. This command will have all of the responsibilities of a Unified Combatant Command in addition to the space-related responsibilities previously assigned to United States Strategic Command. It will also have the responsibilities of the Joint Force provider and Joint Force training for space operations forces. Moving expeditiously toward a Unified Combatant Command reflects the importance of warfighting in space to the Joint Force. The commander of this command will lead space warfighting through global space operations that may occur in the space domain, the terrestrial domains, or through the electromagnetic spectrum.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) With forces provided by the United States Space Force and other United States Armed Forces, the United States Space Command shall ensure unfettered access to, and freedom to operate in, space and provide vital effects and capabilities to joint and coalition forces during peacetime and across the spectrum of conflict.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 8. <i>Relationship with National Intelligence</i>. The Secretary of Defense and the Director of National Intelligence shall create and enhance mechanisms for collaboration between the Department of Defense and the United States Intelligence Community in order to increase unity of effort and the effectiveness of space operations. The Secretary of Defense and the Director of National Intelligence shall provide a report to the President within 180 days of the date of this memorandum [Feb. 19, 2019] on steps they have taken and are planning to take toward these ends, including legislative proposals as necessary and appropriate.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 9. <i>Operational Authorities</i>. In order to ensure that the United States Space Force and United States Space Command have the necessary operational authorities, the National Space Council and the National Security Council shall coordinate an accelerated review of space operational authorities. Within 90 days of the date of this memorandum, the Secretary of Defense shall present to the National Space Council and the National Security Council proposed relevant authority changes for the President's approval. The National Space Council and the National Security Council shall then conduct an interagency review of the Secretary's proposal and make recommendations to the President on appropriate authorities, to be completed no later than 60 days from the date the Secretary of Defense presents his proposal to the councils.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 10. <i>Periodic Review</i>. As the United States Space Force matures, and as national security requires, it will become necessary to create a separate military department, to be known as the Department of the Space Force. This department will take over some or all responsibilities for the United States Space Force from the Department of the Air Force. The Secretary of Defense will conduct periodic reviews to determine when to recommend that the President seek legislation to establish such a department.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 11. <i>General Provisions</i>. (a) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:</p>
<p class="note-body">(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or</p>
<!-- PDFPage:3461 --><p class="note-body">(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.</p>

<p class="note-body">After the enactment of the Officer Personnel Act of 1947, section 308 of the Army Organization Act of 1950 (10:61&ndash;1) provided for an Assistant Judge Advocate General and three brigadier generals in the Judge Advocate General's Corps of the Army. The creation of these four general officer spaces served to increase the mentioned authorized strength figure from 357 to 361, and the figure 201 to 205. The opinion of the Judge Advocate General of the Army (JAGA 1948/5806, 2 Sept. 1948) is in accord with that conclusion.</p>
<p class="note-body">The revised section reflects the authorized strength of the Regular Air Force in general officers on the active list resulting from the mentioned allocation to the Air Force.</p>
<p class="note-body">That allocation, and those mentioned in the explanation of subsection (c) below, have had the force of law since July 26, 1950, when the period for transfers, including the administrative authority to change these allocations, expired.</p>
<p class="note-body">The word &quot;regular&quot; is substituted for the word &quot;permanent&quot; throughout the revised subsection.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), 10:506a(a) (1st proviso) is omitted, since there is no authority to appoint to a regular grade above major general. 10:506a(a) (last 65 words of 2d proviso) is omitted as executed by the declaration of a national emergency on December 16, 1950.</p>

<p class="note-body">The new subsection (e) is necessary to reflect the last 11 words of the second sentence of section 4 of the Army Aviation Cadet Act (formerly 10 U.S.C. 304), which were omitted from the original military codification act, the Act of August 10, 1956, chapter 1041, as part of the source law for section 20(b) of that Act (70A Stat. 627). See Senate Report No. 2484, 84th Congress, 2d Session, page 738. Since the source law did not permit the payment of a money allowance to an aviation cadet in place of the issuance of uniforms, clothing, and equipment, as may be done for enlisted members generally, it is necessary to restate this provision separately. See Opinion of the Deputy General Counsel, Department of Defense, May 29, 1957.</p>

<p class="note-body">The words &quot;under such regulations as he may prescribe&quot;, in 10:455e and 32:164d, are omitted, since the Secretary has inherent authority to issue regulations appropriate to exercising his statutory functions.

<p class="note-body">Subsection (a) consolidates the various service computation provisions applicable to voluntary retirement of commissioned officers. Clause (1) is substituted for 10:951. Clause (2) is substituted for 10:951b. The words &quot;pay period and&quot;, in 10:951a, are omitted as superseded by section 202 of the Career Compensation Act of 1949, 63 Stat. 807 (37 U.S.C. 233). The words &quot;longevity pay and&quot;, in section 7 of the Act of June 18, 1878, ch. 263, 20 Stat. 150, are omitted for the same reason. The last sentence of section 7 of that act is omitted, since the distinction between limited and unlimited retired lists was abolished by section 201 of the Act of June 29, 1948, ch. 708, 62 Stat. 1084. Clause (3) is inserted, since a person entitled to count service under section 8683 of this title might cease to be a nurse or woman medical specialist and thereafter become entitled to retire under one of the revised sections referred to in subsection (a) of this revised section.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the words &quot;as a member of the Medical Reserve Corps&quot;, in 10:953a, are omitted as covered by subsection (a)(1). The words &quot;are computed by adding to his service under subsection (a)&quot; are substituted for the words &quot;shall be credited to the same extent as service under a Regular Army commission&quot;.</p>

<p class="note-body">In the introductory paragraph, the applicability of the rule stated in the third sentence to situations not expressly covered by the laws named in the source statutes above is a practical construction that the rule must be reciprocally applied in all cases.</p>
<p class="note-body">In formula B, the words &quot;basic pay&quot; are substituted for the words &quot;base and longevity pay&quot; to conform to the terminology of the Career Compensation Act of 1949, 63 Stat. 802 (37 U.S.C. 231 et seq.). The words &quot;his retired grade&quot; are substituted for the words &quot;permanent grade held at time of retirement&quot; to reflect the right to higher retired grade when qualified under other provisions of law. 10:941a(e) (last proviso of clause (1)), is omitted, since, under section 202 of the Career Compensation Act of 1949, 63 Stat. 807 (37 U.S.C. 233), the active duty pay of all members of the Air Force is based upon years of service.</p>
<p class="note-body">In formula C, the computation is based on monthly pay instead of annual pay to conform to the other formulas of the revised section. The words &quot;basic pay&quot; are substituted for the words &quot;active duty base and longevity pay&quot;, and the words &quot;in determining his basic pay&quot; are substituted for the words &quot;for longevity pay purposes&quot;, to conform to the terminology of the Career Compensation Act of 1949, 63 Stat. 802 (37 U.S.C. 231 et seq.). The words &quot;Monthly basic pay of member's retired grade&quot; are substituted for the words &quot;the rank upon which they are retired&quot;, in 10:971, and &quot;rank with which retired&quot;, in 10:971b, to reflect their right to advancement on the retired list. 10:971 now applies only when the retiring officer has 30 or more years of service which may be credited in computing his retired pay. 10:971b (2d proviso) is omitted, since, under section 202 of the Career Compensation Act of 1949, 63 Stat. 807 (37 U.S.C. 233), the pay of all members is based upon cumulative years of service. 10:971b (4th proviso) is omitted as executed. 10:971b (last proviso) is omitted, since the distinction between limited and unlimited retired lists was abolished by section 201 of the Act of June 29, 1948, ch. 708, 62 Stat. 1084. Sections 8918, 8920, and 8924 are included under this formula, since it achieves the same result as is reached on a basis of 30 years multiplied by 2&#189; percent, and simplifies the table.</p>
<p class="note-body">In formulas D and E the words &quot;credited under section 8925&quot; are substituted for the words &quot;active Federal service&quot;, since that revised section makes explicit the service covered. The Act of August 10, 1946, ch. 952, &sect;6(c), 60 Stat. 996, is not contained in 10:948. It is also omitted from the revised section as executed. 10:980 now applies only when the retiring enlisted member has at least 30 years of service which may be credited in computing his retired pay. However, as noted above, 10:980 is the only provision of law applicable to cases in which the retiring member has at least 30 years of service. The Act of June 16, 1942, ch. 413, &sect;19 (63d through 75th words of 2d par.), 56 Stat. 369, repealed so much of the Act of March 2, 1907, ch. 2513, 34 Stat. 1217, as provided allowances for enlisted men on the retired list. The repeal of section 19 of the Act of June 16, 1942, by section 531(b)(34) of the Career Compensation Act of 1949, 63 Stat. 839, did not revive that portion of the Act of March 2, 1907, which had been repealed by the Act of June 16, 1942. Accordingly, the Act of March 2, 1907, as thus modified by the Act of June 16, 1942, is used as the basis for formula E.</p>
<p class="note-body">Footnote 2 reflects the long-standing construction of those provisions dealing with computation of retired pay which do not specifically provide that the member is entitled to compute his retired pay on the basis of the monthly basic pay to which he would be entitled if he were on active duty in his retired grade. Except in cases covered by formula C, the pertinent basic computation provisions for such retirement either provide for computation of retired pay on the same basis as the provisions dealing with higher retired grade, or the basic retirement provisions were themselves enacted after the provisions authorizing higher retired grade. The provisos of 10:1002 and 1005 are omitted as surplusage, since no formula for the computation of retired pay includes inactive service on the retired list as a credit.</p>
<p class="note-body">The words &quot;at rates applicable on date of retirement and adjust to reflect later changes in permanent rates&quot;, in footnote 2; and all of footnote 4; are based on the source statutes incorporated in the formulas to which footnotes 2 and 4 apply.</p>
<p class="note-body">In footnote 4, the words &quot;and disregard a part of a year that is less than six months&quot; are made applicable to formulas A&ndash;E, although this part of the rule is expressed only as to formula B, in 10:941a(4)(1). The legislative history of the Career Compensation Act of 1949 (Hearings before the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate on H.R. 5007, 81st Congress, first session, p. 313, July 6, 1949) indicates that the provisions, upon which formulas A and C&ndash;E are based, should be construed to require that a part of a year that is less than six months be disregarded.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;9514. Indemnification of Department of Transportation for losses covered by defense-related aviation insurance</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Prompt Indemnification Required</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) In the event of a loss that is covered by defense-related aviation insurance, the Secretary of Defense shall promptly indemnify the Secretary of Transportation for the amount of the loss consistent with the indemnification agreement between the two Secretaries that underlies such insurance. The Secretary of Defense shall make such indemnification&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) in the case of a claim for the loss of an aircraft hull, not later than 30 days after the date on which the Secretary of Transportation determines the claim to be payable or that amounts are due under the policy that provided the defense-related aviation insurance; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in the case of any other claim, not later than 180 days after the date on which the Secretary of Transportation determines the claim to be payable.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) When there is a loss of an aircraft hull that is (or may be) covered by defense-related aviation insurance, the Secretary of Transportation may make, during the period when a claim for such loss is pending with the Secretary of Transportation, any required periodic payments owed by the insured party to a lessor or mortgagee of such aircraft. Such payments shall commence not later than 30 days following the date of the presentment of the claim for the loss of the aircraft hull to the Secretary of Transportation. If the Secretary of Transportation determines that the claim is payable, any amount paid under this paragraph arising from such claim shall be credited against the amount payable under the aviation insurance. If the Secretary of Transportation determines that the claim is not payable, any amount paid under this paragraph arising from such claim shall constitute a debt to the United States, payable to the insurance fund. Any such amounts so returned to the United States shall be promptly credited to the fund or account from which the payments were made under this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Source of Funds for Payment of Indemnity</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Defense may pay an indemnity described in subsection (a) from any funds available to the Department of Defense for operation and maintenance, and such sums as may be necessary for payment of such indemnity are hereby authorized to be transferred to the Secretary of Transportation for such purpose.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Notice to Congress</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In the event of a loss that is covered by defense-related aviation insurance in the case of an incident in which the covered loss is (or is expected to be) in an amount in excess of $10,000,000, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to Congress notification of the loss as soon after the occurrence of the loss as possible and in no event more than 30 days after the date of the loss.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Implementing Matters</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Payment of indemnification under this section is not subject to section 2214 or 2215 of this title or any other provision of law requiring notification to Congress before funds may be transferred.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Consolidation of claims arising from the same incident is not required before indemnification of the Secretary of Transportation for payment of a claim may be made under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Construction With Other Transfer Authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Authority to transfer funds under this section is in addition to any other authority provided by law to transfer funds (whether enacted before, on, or after the date of the enactment of this section) and is not subject to any dollar limitation or notification requirement contained in any other such authority to transfer funds.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Definitions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this section:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Defense-related aviation insurance</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The term &quot;defense-related aviation insurance&quot; means aviation insurance and reinsurance provided through policies issued by the Secretary of Transportation under chapter 443 of title 49 that pursuant to section 44305(b) of that title is provided by that Secretary without pre<!-- PDFPage:3552 -->mium at the request of the Secretary of Defense and is covered by an indemnity agreement between the Secretary of Transportation and the Secretary of Defense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Loss</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The term &quot;loss&quot; includes damage to or destruction of property, personal injury or death, and other liabilities and expenses covered by the defense-related aviation insurance.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;9515. Charter air transportation services: minimum annual purchase amount for carriers participating in Civil Reserve Air Fleet</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>In General</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall take steps to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) improve the predictability in Department of Defense charter requirements;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) strengthen Civil Reserve Airlift Fleet participation to assure adequate capacity is available to meet steady-state, surge and mobilization requirements; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) provide incentives for commercial air carriers to provide newer, more efficient and reliable aircraft for Department of Defense service rather than older, fully depreciated aircraft.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Consideration of Recommendations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In carrying out subsection (a), the Secretary shall consider the recommendations on courses of action for the Civil Reserve Air Fleet as outlined in the report required by section 356 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 (Public Law 110&ndash;181).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Contracts for Charter Air Transportation Services</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may award to an air carrier or an air carrier contractor team arrangement participating in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet on a fiscal year basis a one-year contract for charter air transportation services with a minimum purchase amount under such contract determined in accordance with this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Eligible Charter Air Transportation Carriers</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In order to be eligible for payments under the minimum purchase amount provided by this section, an air carrier (or any air carrier participating in an air carrier contractor team arrangement)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) if under contract with the Department of Defense in the prior fiscal year, shall have an average on-time pick up rate, based on factors within such air carrier's control, of at least 90 percent;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) shall offer such amount of commitment to the Civil Reserve Air Fleet in excess of the minimum required for participation in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet as the Secretary shall specify for purposes of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) may not have refused a Department of Defense request to act as a host for other Civil Reserve Air Fleet carriers at intermediate staging bases during the prior fiscal year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Aggregate Minimum Purchase Amount</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The aggregate amount of the minimum purchase amount for all contracts awarded under subsection (c) for a fiscal year shall be based on forecast needs, but may not exceed the amount equal to 80 percent of the average annual expenditure of the Department of Defense for charter air transportation services during the five-fiscal year period ending in the fiscal year before the fiscal year for which such contracts are awarded.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In calculating the average annual expenditure of the Department of Defense for charter air transportation services for purposes of paragraph (1), the Secretary shall omit from the calculation any fiscal year exhibiting unusually high demand for charter air transportation services if the Secretary determines that the omission of such fiscal year from the calculation will result in a more accurate forecast of anticipated charter air transportation services for purposes of that paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Allocation of Minimum Purchase Among Charter Air Transportation Contracts</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The aggregate amount of the minimum purchase amount for all contracts awarded under subsection (c) for a fiscal year, as determined under subsection (e), shall be allocated among all air carriers and air carrier contractor team arrangements awarded contracts under subsection (c) for such fiscal year in proportion to the commitments of such carriers to the Civil Reserve Air Fleet for such fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In determining the minimum purchase amount payable under paragraph (1) under a contract under subsection (c) for charter air transportation services provided by an air carrier or air carrier contractor team arrangement during the fiscal year covered by such contract, the Secretary may adjust the amount allocated to such carrier or arrangement under paragraph (1) to take into account periods during such fiscal year when charter air transportation services of such carrier or a carrier in such arrange<!-- PDFPage:3553 -->ment are unavailable for usage by the Department of Defense, including during periods of refused business or suspended operations or when such carrier is placed in nonuse status pursuant to section 2640 of this title for safety reasons.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Distribution of Amounts</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If any amount available under this section for the minimum purchase of charter air transportation services from a carrier or air carrier contractor team arrangement for a fiscal year under a contract under subsection (c) is not utilized to purchase charter air transportation services from the carrier or arrangement in such fiscal year, such amount shall be provided to the carrier or arrangement before the first day of the following fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Commitment of Funds</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of each military department shall transfer to the transportation working capital fund a percentage of the total amount anticipated to be required in such fiscal year for the payment of minimum purchase amounts under all contracts awarded under subsection (c) for such fiscal year equivalent to the percentage of the anticipated use of charter air transportation services by such military department during such fiscal year from all carriers under contracts awarded under subsection (c) for such fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any amounts required to be transferred under paragraph (1) shall be transferred by the last day of the fiscal year concerned to meet the requirements of subsection (g) unless minimum purchase amounts have already been distributed by the Secretary under subsection (g) as of that date.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) <cap-smallcap>Availability of Airlift Services</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) From the total amount of charter air transportation services available for a fiscal year under all contracts awarded under subsection (c) for such fiscal year, a military department shall be entitled to obtain a percentage of such services equal to the percentage of the contribution of the military department to the transportation working capital fund for such fiscal year under subsection (h).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A military department may transfer any entitlement to charter air transportation services under paragraph (1) to any other military department or to any other agency, element, or component of the Department of Defense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j) <cap-smallcap>Definition</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this section, the term &quot;charter air transportation&quot; has the meaning given such term in section 40102(14) of title 49.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the word &quot;members&quot; is substituted for the words &quot;officers and enlisted men&quot;, in 10:1237. Clause (2) is substituted for 10:904. Reference to the Secretary of the Air Force is substituted for reference to branch, office, or officers of the Army, in 10:1237, since the functions which, for the Army are assigned to subordinate officers, are, for the Air Force assigned to the Secretary of the Air Force. 32:156 is omitted as covered by 10:904, since the words &quot;officers of the Air Force&quot; necessarily cover all persons named in 32:156. The words &quot;Except for articles and items acquired through the use of working capital funds under sections 172&ndash;172j of title 5&quot; are inserted to reflect Title IV of the National Security Act of 1947, as amended (63 Stat. 585), which authorized the Secretary of Defense to prescribe regulations governing the use and sale of certain inventories at cost, including applicable administrative expenses. (See opinion of the Assistant General Counsel (Fiscal Matters) of the Office of the Secretary of Defense, January 4, 1955.)</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the first sentence states expressly the rule which is implicit in 10:1238. The word &quot;members&quot; is substituted for the words &quot;officers and enlisted men&quot;. The words &quot;shall be understood, in all cases of such sales&quot; are omitted as surplusage. The last sentence is inserted to reflect Title IV of the National Security Act of 1947, as amended (63 Stat. 585), which authorized the Secretary of Defense to prescribe regulations governing the use and sale of certain inventories at cost, including applicable administrative expenses. (See opinion of the Deputy General Counsel of the Office of the Secretary of Defense, March 28, 1956.)</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), the word &quot;members&quot; is substituted for the words &quot;officers and enlisted men&quot;. The words &quot;prices at which like property is sold to&quot; are substituted for the words &quot;same price as is charged the&quot;.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsections (c) and (d), the words &quot;other armed forces&quot; are substituted for the words &quot;Navy and Marine Corps&quot;, since such sales are authorized to members of the Coast Guard by section 144(b) of Title 14.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (d), the words &quot;other than subsistence supplies&quot; are inserted, since the sale of subsistence supplies is covered by subsection (c).</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (e), the words &quot;a person who has been discharged&quot; are substituted for the words &quot;discharged officers and enlisted men&quot;. The words &quot;Navy *&#160;*&#160;* or Marine Corps&quot;, omitted from the 1952 edition of the United States Code, are inserted to conform to the <!-- PDFPage:3563 -->source statute. The words &quot;may buy&quot; are substituted for the words &quot;shall *&#160;*&#160;* be permitted to purchase&quot;. The words &quot;at the prices at which like property is sold&quot; are substituted for the words &quot;at the same price as charged&quot;. The word &quot;member&quot; is substituted for the words &quot;officers and enlisted men&quot;. The words &quot;while undergoing such care and treatment&quot; are omitted as surplusage.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (f), the words &quot;person who has been discharged&quot; are substituted for the words &quot;former members *&#160;*&#160;* who have been separated therefrom&quot;. The words &quot;at the prices at which like articles are sold to members&quot; are inserted to conform to the last sentence of subsection (a) and subsection (e).</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (g), the words &quot;regulations to be prescribed by the Secretary&quot; are substituted for the words &quot;Army Regulations&quot;. The words &quot;of the Government&quot; are omitted as surplusage. 10:1253 (last 22 words of 1st sentence) is omitted as surplusage. The words &quot;or to another executive department of the Government&quot; are omitted as superseded by section 7 of the act of May 21, 1920, ch. 194, as amended (31 U.S.C. 686). The provisions of 10:1253 relating to the computation of cost are omitted to reflect Title IV of the National Security Act of 1947, as amended (63 Stat. 585), which authorized the Secretary of Defense to prescribe regulations governing the use and sale of certain inventories at cost, including applicable administrative expenses. (See opinion of the Assistant General Counsel (Fiscal Matters) of the Office of the Secretary of Defense, January 4, 1955.)</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (h), the word &quot;outside&quot; is substituted for the words &quot;beyond the continental limitations&quot;. The words &quot;or in Alaska&quot; are omitted, since, under section 101(1) of this title, the words &quot;United States&quot; are defined to include only the States and the District of Columbia. The word &quot;continental&quot;, after the words &quot;within the&quot;, is omitted for the same reason. The last sentence is substituted for 10:1241 (proviso).</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (i), 10:1196 (last 30 words) is omitted as superseded by the Act of April 27, 1914, ch. 72 (last proviso under &quot;Subsistence of the Army&quot;), 38 Stat. 361. The words &quot;So much of the&quot; and &quot;as may be necessary&quot; are omitted as surplusage. The words &quot;members *&#160;*&#160;* on active duty, for the use of themselves and their families&quot; are substituted for the words &quot;officers for the use of themselves and their families, and to commanders of companies or other organizations, for the use of the enlisted men of their companies or organizations&quot;, to conform to 10:1237 and 1238. Those sections provide the basic authority for procurement and sale of subsistence supplies to all members. This interpretation conforms to established administrative practice under those sections. The word &quot;supplies&quot; is substituted for the word &quot;stores&quot;.</p>

The Acts of March 3, 1899, ch. 643 (1st proviso under &quot;Ordnance Department&quot;), 30 Stat. 1073; and May 26, 1900, ch. 586 (1st proviso under &quot;Ordnance Department&quot;), 31 Stat. 216, as amended, relating to disposal of ordnance to &quot;Homes for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers&quot; by the Chief of Ordnance of the Army, became inoperative when the Homes were dissolved. Although section 402(e) of the Army Organization Act of 1950, ch. 383, 64 Stat. 273, amended the Act of May 26, 1900, it did not have the effect of reviving that act. The word &quot;give&quot; is substituted for the word &quot;deliver&quot; to express more clearly the intent of the section. The words &quot;serviceable&quot; and &quot;as may be on hand undisposed of&quot; are omitted as surplusage. The word &quot;may&quot; is substituted for the words &quot;is authorized and directed&quot;, since section 9684 of this title provides an alternative method for the disposal of obsolete cannon.</p>
