<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), all references to the appointment of assistant chiefs are omitted as covered by sections 3037 and 3040 of this title. All references to the grade of brigadier general are omitted, since 10:21f(b) specifies the grade of major general for the offices. 10:559g(a) (4th sentence) is omitted as surplusage, since the appointment is to a permanent grade. 10:559g(a) (6th and 7th sentences) is omitted as executed. 10:559g(a) (last sentence) is omitted, since the revised section applies only to the officers named in subsection (a). The words &quot;except the Judge Advocate General&quot; are inserted for clarity. The eight words before clause (1), and clauses (1) and (2), are substituted for the words &quot;as prescribed in section 559g of this title&quot;, in 10:21f(b), and 10:559g(a) (1st sentence).

<p class="note-body">In subsection (e), the introductory clause is substituted for 10:559g(b) (words before colon of 1st sentence). The words &quot;in a grade above major general&quot; are substituted for the words &quot;of a rank above that of the position for which selections are to be made&quot;, since all the positions are in the grade of major general. The word &quot;select&quot; is substituted for the word &quot;appoint&quot;, since the filling of the offices is not appointment to an office in the constitutional sense. The word &quot;extensive&quot; is substituted for the word &quot;extended&quot;, except where it refers to &quot;extended&quot; active duty, in which <!-- PDFPage:2984 -->case the word &quot;extended&quot; is omitted as surplusage.

<h4 class="note-head">1958 Act</h4>
<p class="note-body">The change corrects an inadvertence. The source statute for section 3036(c) of title 10 (the third sentence of sec. 513(a) of the Officer Personnel Act of 1947, 61 Stat. 901), providing for a 4-year term of office, applied also to the Judge Advocate General and the Assistant Judge Advocate General. As restated in section 3036(c), it now applies only to the officers named in section 3036(b), which excludes the two officers named. For this reason, the effect of the source statute with respect to those officers is added to section 3037(a), relating to their appointment.</p>

<p class="note-body">After the enactment of the Officer Personnel Act of 1947, section 308 of the Army Organization Act of 1950 (10:61&ndash;1) provided for an Assistant Judge Advocate General and three brigadier generals in the Judge Advocate General's Corps of the Army. The creation of these four general officer spaces served to increase the mentioned authorized strength figure from 357 to 361, and the figure 201 to 205. The opinion of the Judge Advocate General of the Army (JAGA 1948/5806, 2 Sept. 1948) is in accord with that conclusion.</p>
<p class="note-body">The revised section reflects the authorized strength of the Regular Army in general officers on the active list resulting from the mentioned allocation to the Air Force and the addition of four general officer spaces in the Judge Advocate General's Corps.</p>
<p class="note-body">That allocation, and those mentioned in the explanation of [former] subsection (c), below, have had the force of law since July 26, 1950, when the period for transfers, including the administrative authority to change these allocations, expired.</p>
<p class="note-body">The word &quot;regular&quot; is substituted for the word &quot;permanent&quot; throughout the revised section.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), 10:506a(a) (1st proviso) is omitted, since there is no authority to appoint to a Regular grade above major general. 10:506a(a) (last 65 words of 2d proviso) is omitted as executed by the declaration of a national emergency on December 16, 1950.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c)(1), the figures &quot;12&quot; and &quot;6&quot; result from the allocation of the original figures &quot;16&quot; and &quot;8&quot;.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c)(2), the figures &quot;3&quot; and &quot;2&quot; result from the allocation of the original figures &quot;4&quot; and &quot;2&quot;.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c)(3), the figure &quot;1&quot; results from the allocation of the original figure &quot;1&quot;. None was allocated to the Air Force.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c)(4), the figure &quot;1&quot; results from the allocation of the original figures &quot;2&quot; and &quot;1&quot;. (The major general was allocated to the Army, the brigadier general to the Air Force.)</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c)(5), the figures &quot;188&quot; and &quot;94&quot; result from the allocation of the original figures &quot;334&quot; and &quot;167&quot;. The allocation of 188 corresponds to the allotment made by the Secretary of War between the Air Corps and the Army exclusive of the Air Corps, the Medical Department, and the Chaplains, under 10:506a(a) (3d proviso). That proviso is omitted as executed.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (e), the words &quot;by law to hold any civil office under the United States&quot; are substituted for the words &quot;by Acts of Congress to hold appointments in the Diplomatic or Consular Service of the Government or to hold any civil office under the Government&quot;.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) A person is not entitled to be reenlisted under this section if&mdash;</p>

<p class="note-body">Subsection (a) consolidates the various service computation provisions applicable to voluntary retirement of commissioned officers. Clause (1) is substituted for 10:951. Clause (2) is substituted for 10:951b. The words &quot;pay period and&quot;, in 10:951a, are omitted as superseded by section 202 of the Career Compensation Act of 1949, 63 Stat. 807 (37 U.S.C. 233). The words &quot;longevity pay and&quot;, in section 7 of the act of June 18, 1878, ch. 263, 20 Stat. 150, are omitted for the same reason. The last sentence of section 7 of that act is omitted, since the distinction between limited and unlimited retired lists was abolished by section 201 of the act of June 29, 1948, ch. 708, 62 Stat. 1084. Clause (3) is inserted, since a person entitled to count service under section 3683 of this title might cease to be a nurse or woman medical specialist and thereafter become entitled to retire under one of the revised sections referred to in subsection (a) of this revised section.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the words &quot;as a member of the Medical Reserve Corps&quot;, in 10:953a, are omitted as covered by subsection (a)(1). The words &quot;are computed by adding to his service under subsection (a)&quot; are substituted for the words &quot;shall be credited to the same extent as service under a Regular Army commission&quot;.</p>

<p class="note-body">In the introductory paragraph, the applicability of the rule stated in the third sentence to situations not expressly covered by the laws named in the source statutes above is a practical construction that the rule must be reciprocally applied in all cases.</p>
<p class="note-body">In formula B, the words &quot;basic pay&quot; are substituted for the words &quot;base and longevity pay&quot; to conform to the terminology of the Career Compensation Act of <!-- PDFPage:3037 -->1949, 63 Stat. 802 (37 U.S.C. 231 et seq.). The words &quot;his retired grade&quot; are substituted for the words &quot;permanent grade held at time of retirement&quot; to reflect the right to higher retired grade when qualified under other provisions of law. 10:941a(e) (last proviso of clause (1)) is omitted, since, under section 202 of the Career Compensation Act of 1949, 63 Stat. 807 (37 U.S.C. 233), the active duty pay of all members of the Army is based upon years of service.</p>
<p class="note-body">In formula C, the computation is based on monthly pay instead of annual pay to conform to the other formulas of the revised section. The words &quot;basic pay&quot; are substituted for the words &quot;active duty base and longevity pay&quot;, and the words &quot;in determining his basic pay&quot; are substituted for the words &quot;for longevity pay purposes&quot;, to conform to the terminology of the Career Compensation Act of 1949, 63 Stat. 802 (37 U.S.C. 231 et seq.). The words &quot;Monthly basic pay of member's retired grade&quot; are substituted for the words &quot;the rank upon which they are retired&quot;, in 10:971, and &quot;rank with which retired&quot;, in 10:971b, to reflect their right to advancement on the retired list. 10:971 now applies only when the retiring officer has 30 or more years of service which may be credited in computing his retired pay. 10:971b (2d proviso) is omitted, since, under section 202 of the Career Compensation Act of 1949, 63 Stat. 807 (37 U.S.C. 233), the pay of all members is based upon cumulative years of service. 10:971b (4th proviso) is omitted as executed. 10:971b (last proviso) is omitted, since the distinction between limited and unlimited retired lists was abolished by section 201 of the act of June 29, 1948, ch. 708, 62 Stat. 1084. Sections 3918, 3920, and 3924 are included under this formula, since it achieves the same result as is reached on a basis of 30 years multiplied by 2&#189; percent, and simplifies the table.</p>
<p class="note-body">In formulas D and E, the words &quot;credited under section 3925&quot; are substituted for the words &quot;active Federal service&quot;, since that revised section makes explicit the service covered. The act of August 10, 1946, ch. 952, &sect;6(c), 60 Stat. 996, is not contained in 10:948. It is also omitted from the revised section as executed. 10:980 now applies only when the retiring enlisted member has at least 30 years of service which may be credited in computing his retired pay. However, as noted above, 10:980 is the only provision of law applicable to cases in which the retiring member has at least 30 years of service. The act of June 16, 1942, ch. 413, &sect;19 (63d through 75th words of 2d par.), 56 Stat. 369, repealed so much of the act of March 2, 1907, ch. 2513, 34 Stat. 1217, as provided allowances for enlisted men on the retired list. The repeal of section 19 of the act of June 16, 1942, by section 531(b)(34) of the Career Compensation Act of 1949, 63 Stat. 839, did not revive that portion of the act of March 2, 1907, which had been repealed by the act of June 16, 1942. Accordingly, the act of March 2, 1907, as thus modified by the act of June 16, 1942, is used as the basis for formula E.</p>
<p class="note-body">Footnote 2 reflects the long-standing construction of those provisions dealing with computation of retired pay which do not specifically provide that the member is entitled to compute his retired pay on the basis of the monthly basic pay to which he would be entitled if he were on active duty in his retired grade. Except in cases covered by formula C the pertinent basic computation provisions for such retirement either provide for computation of retired pay on the same basis as the provisions dealing with higher retired grade, or the basic retirement provisions were themselves enacted after the provisions authorizing higher retired grade. The provisos of 10:1002 and 1005 are omitted as surplusage, since no formula for the computation of retired pay includes inactive service on the retired list as a credit.</p>
<p class="note-body">The words &quot;at rates applicable on date of retirement and adjust to reflect later changes in permanent rates&quot;, in footnote 2; and all of footnote 4; are based on the source statutes incorporated in the formulas to which footnotes 2 and 4 apply.</p>
<p class="note-body">In footnote 4, the words &quot;and disregard a part of a year that is less than six months&quot; are made applicable to formulas A&mdash;E although this part of the rule is expressed only as to formula B, in 10:941a(e)(1). The legislative history of the Career Compensation Act of 1949 (Hearings before the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate on H.R. 5007, 81st Congress, first session, p. 313, July 6, 1949) indicates that the provisions, upon which formulas A and C&mdash;E are based, should be construed to require that a part of a year that is less than six months be disregarded.</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(1) Review the overall process used by the Department of the Army for selection of drill sergeants to determine&mdash;</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(7) Provide each drill sergeant in training with the opportunity, before or during that training, to work with new recruits in initial entry training and to be evaluated on that opportunity.</p>

The words &quot;necessary for his proper equipment&quot; are substituted for 10:442 (last 22 words of 1st sentence). The words &quot;and at cost price, plus 10 per centum&quot; are omitted to reflect Title IV of the National Security Act of 1947, as amended (63 Stat. 585), which authorized the Secretary of Defense to prescribe regulations governing the use and sale of certain inventories at cost, including applicable administrative expenses.

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">An account of sales on credit shall be kept and the amount due reported to any branch, office, or officer designated by the Secretary.

<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the word &quot;members&quot; is substituted for the words &quot;officers and enlisted men&quot; in 10:1237. Clause (2) is substituted for 10:904. 32:156 is omitted as covered by 10:904, since the words &quot;officers of the Army&quot; necessarily cover all persons named in 32:156. The words &quot;the Secretary of the Army or a person designated by him&quot; are substituted for the words &quot;by whatever branch, office, or officers of the Army the Secretary of the Army may from time to time designate&quot;, inserted by the Editors of the United States Code. R.S. 1114 which provided that this function should be invested in the Inspector General was not amended in this respect by section 402(a) of the Army Organization Act of 1950 (64 Stat. 272). However, these functions have now been transferred to the Secretary of the Army or a person designated by him. (See memorandum of the Secretary of Defense, dated October 29, 1954, subject &quot;Transfer of Authority from the Inspector General to the Secretary of the Army to Designate Subsistence Articles for Sale,&quot; and opinion of the Judge Advocate General of the Army (JAGA 1954/9712, 2 December 1954).) The words &quot;Except for articles and items acquired through the use of working capital funds under sections 172&ndash;172j of title 5&quot; are inserted to reflect Title IV of the National Security Act of 1947, as amended (63 Stat. 585), which authorized the Secretary of Defense to prescribe regulations governing the use and sale of certain inventories at cost, including applicable administrative expenses. (See opinion of the Assistant General Counsel (Fiscal Matters) of the Office of the Secretary of Defense, January 4, 1955.)</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the first sentence states expressly the rule which is implicit in 10:1238. The word &quot;members&quot; is substituted for the words &quot;officers and enlisted men&quot;. The words &quot;shall be understood, in all cases of such sales&quot; are omitted as surplusage. The last sentence is inserted to reflect Title IV of the National Security Act of 1947, as amended (63 Stat. 585), which authorized the Secretary of Defense to prescribe regulations governing the use and sale of certain inventories at cost, including applicable administrative expenses. (See opinion of the Deputy General Counsel of the Office of the Secretary of Defense, March 28, 1956.)</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), the word &quot;members&quot; is substituted for the words &quot;officers and enlisted men&quot;. The words &quot;prices at which like property is sold to&quot; are substituted for the words &quot;same price as is charged the&quot;.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsections (c) and (d), the words &quot;other armed forces&quot; are substituted for the words &quot;Navy and Marine Corps&quot;, since such sales are authorized to members of the Coast Guard by section 144(b) of title 14.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (d), the words &quot;other than subsistence supplies&quot; are inserted, since the sale of subsistence supplies is covered by subsection (c).</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (e), the words &quot;a person who has been discharged&quot; are substituted for the words &quot;discharged officers and enlisted men&quot;. The words &quot;Navy *&#160;*&#160;* or Marine Corps&quot;, omitted from the 1952 Edition of the United States Code, are inserted to conform to the source statute. The words &quot;may buy&quot; are substituted for the words &quot;shall *&#160;*&#160;* be permitted to purchase&quot;. The words &quot;at the prices at which like property is sold&quot; are substituted for the words &quot;at the same price as charged&quot;. The word &quot;member&quot; is substituted for the words &quot;officers and enlisted men&quot;. The words &quot;while undergoing such care and treatment&quot; are omitted as surplusage.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (f), the words &quot;person who has been discharged&quot; are substituted for the words &quot;former members *&#160;*&#160;* who have been separated therefrom&quot;. The words &quot;at the prices at which like articles are sold to members&quot; are inserted to conform to the last sentence of subsection (a) and subsection (e).</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (g), the words &quot;regulations to be prescribed by the Secretary&quot; are substituted for the words &quot;Army Regulations&quot;. The words &quot;of the Government&quot; are omitted as surplusage. 10:1253 (last 22 words of 1st sentence) is omitted as surplusage. The words &quot;or to another executive department of the Government&quot; are omitted as superseded by section 7 of the Act of May 21, 1920, ch. 194, as amended (31 U.S.C. 686). The provisions of 10:1253 relating to computation of costs are omitted to reflect Title IV of the National Security Act of 1947, as amended (63 Stat. 585), which authorized the Secretary of Defense to prescribe regulations governing the use and sale of certain inventories at cost, including applicable administrative expenses. (See opinion of <!-- PDFPage:3106 -->the Assistant General Counsel (Fiscal Matters) of the Office of the Secretary of Defense, January 4, 1955.)</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (h), the word &quot;outside&quot; is substituted for the words &quot;beyond the continental limitations&quot;. The words &quot;or in Alaska&quot; are omitted, since, under section 101(1) of this title, the words &quot;United States&quot; are defined to include only the States and the District of Columbia. The word &quot;continental&quot;, after the words &quot;within the&quot;, is omitted for the same reason. The last sentence is substituted for 10:1241 (proviso).</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (i), 10:1196 (last 30 words) is omitted as superseded by the Act of April 27, 1914, ch. 72 (last proviso under &quot;Subsistence of the Army&quot;), 38 Stat. 361. The words &quot;So much of the&quot; and &quot;as may be necessary&quot; are omitted as surplusage. The words &quot;members *&#160;*&#160;* on active duty, for the use of themselves and their families&quot; are substituted for the words &quot;officers for the use of themselves and their families, and to commanders of companies or other organizations, for the use of the enlisted men of their companies or organizations&quot;, to conform to 10:1237 and 1238. Those sections provide the basic authority for procurement and sale of subsistence supplies to all members. This interpretation conforms to established administrative practice under those sections. The word &quot;supplies&quot; is substituted for the word &quot;stores&quot;.</p>
