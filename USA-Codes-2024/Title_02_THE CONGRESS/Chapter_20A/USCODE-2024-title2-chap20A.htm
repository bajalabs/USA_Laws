<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">As used in this chapter&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The term &quot;BBEDCA&quot; means the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The definitions set forth in section 622 of this title and in section 250 of BBEDCA [2 U.S.C. 900] shall apply to this chapter, except to the extent that they are specifically modified as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The term &quot;outyear&quot; means a fiscal year one or more years after the budget year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) In section 250(c)(8)(C) [2 U.S.C. 900(c)(8)(C)], the reference to the food stamp program shall be deemed to be a reference to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The term &quot;AMT&quot; means the Alternative Minimum Tax for individuals under sections 55&ndash;59 of title 26, the term &quot;EGTRRA&quot; means the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 (Public Law 107&ndash;16), and the term &quot;JGTRRA&quot; means the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief and&#160;<sup><a href="#932_1_target" name="932_1">1</a></sup> Reconciliation Act of 2003 (Public Law 108&ndash;27).</p>
<!-- PDFPage:285 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(4)(A) The term &quot;budgetary effects&quot; means the amount by which PAYGO legislation changes outlays flowing from direct spending or revenues relative to the baseline and shall be determined on the basis of estimates prepared under section 933 of this title. Budgetary effects that increase outlays flowing from direct spending or decrease revenues are termed &quot;costs&quot; and budgetary effects that increase revenues or decrease outlays flowing from direct spending are termed &quot;savings&quot;. Budgetary effects shall not include any costs associated with debt service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) For purposes of these definitions, off-budget effects shall not be counted as budgetary effects.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Solely for purposes of recording entries on a PAYGO scorecard, provisions in appropriation Acts are also considered to be budgetary effects for purposes of this chapter if such provisions make outyear modifications to substantive law, except that provisions for which the outlay effects net to zero over a period consisting of the current year, the budget year, and the 4 subsequent years shall not be considered budgetary effects. For purposes of this paragraph, the term, &quot;modifications to substantive law&quot; refers to changes to or restrictions on entitlement law or other mandatory spending contained in appropriations Acts, notwithstanding section 250(c)(8) of BBEDCA [2 U.S.C. 900(c)(8)]. Provisions in appropriations Acts that are neither outyear modifications to substantive law nor changes in revenues have no budgetary effects for purposes of this chapter.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) The term &quot;PAYGO legislation&quot; or a &quot;PAYGO Act&quot; refers to a bill or joint resolution that affects direct spending or revenue relative to the baseline. The budgetary effects of changes in revenues and outyear modifications to substantive law included in appropriation Acts as defined in paragraph (4) shall be treated as if they were contained in PAYGO legislation or a PAYGO Act.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) The term &quot;timing shift&quot; refers to a delay of the date on which outlays flowing from direct spending would otherwise occur from the ninth outyear to the tenth outyear or an acceleration of the date on which revenues would otherwise occur from the tenth outyear to the ninth outyear.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Current policy adjustments for certain legislation</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Baseline</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any estimate made pursuant to subparagraph (A) shall be prepared using baseline estimates supplied by the Congressional Budget Office, consistent with section 907 of this title.

<p class="statutory-body-2em">To the extent the adjustment for current policy of any provision estimated under this subsection exceeds the estimated budgetary effects of that provision, these excess savings shall not be available to offset the costs of any provisions not otherwise eligible for a current policy adjustment under section 936 of this title, and shall not be counted on the PAYGO scorecards established pursuant to subsections (d)(4) and (d)(5).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Prohibition on use of excess savings across budget areas</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For provisions eligible for a current policy adjustment under subsections (c) through (f) of section 936 of this title, to the extent the adjustment for current policy of any provision exceeds the estimated budgetary effects of that same provision, the excess savings shall be available only to offset the costs of other provisions that qualify for a current policy adjustment in that same subsection. Each paragraph in section 936(f)(1) of this title shall be considered a separate subsection for purposes of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Further guidance on estimating budgetary effects</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Estimates of budgetary effects under this subsection shall be consistent with the guidance provided at section 936(h) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Inclusion of statement</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">OMB shall maintain and make publicly available a continuously updated document containing two PAYGO scorecards displaying the budgetary effects of PAYGO legislation as determined under section 639 of this title, applying the look-back requirement in subsection (e) and the averaging requirement in subsection (f), and a separate addendum displaying the estimates of the costs of provisions designated in statute as emergency requirements.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Estimates in legislation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (3), in making the calculations for the PAYGO scorecards, OMB shall use the budgetary effects included by reference in the applicable legislation pursuant to subsection (a).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) OMB PAYGO estimates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a PAYGO Act does not contain a valid reference to its budgetary effects consistent with subsection (a), OMB shall estimate the budgetary effects of that legislation upon its enactment. The OMB estimate shall be based on the approaches to scorekeeping set forth in section 639 of this title, as amended by this title,<sup><a href="#933_3_target" name="933_3">3</a></sup> and subsection (g)(4), and shall use the same economic and technical assumptions as used in the most recent budget submitted by the President under section 1105(a) of title 31.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Look-back to capture current-year effects</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, OMB shall treat the budgetary effects of PAYGO legislation enacted during a session of Congress that occur during the current year as though they occurred in the budget year.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:288 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Averaging used to measure compliance over 5-year and 10-year periods</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">OMB shall cumulate the budgetary effects of a PAYGO Act over the budget year (which includes any look-back effects under subsection (e)) and&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) for purposes of the 5-year scorecard referred to in subsection (d)(4), the four subsequent outyears, divide that cumulative total by five, and enter the quotient in the budget-year column and in each subsequent column of the 5-year PAYGO scorecard; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) for purposes of the 10-year scorecard referred to in subsection (d)(5), the nine subsequent outyears, divide that cumulative total by ten, and enter the quotient in the budget-year column and in each subsequent column of the 10-year PAYGO scorecard.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Emergency legislation</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Designation in statute</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a provision of direct spending or revenue legislation in a PAYGO Act is enacted as an emergency requirement that the Congress so designates in statute pursuant to this section, the amounts of new budget authority, outlays, and revenue in all fiscal years resulting from that provision shall be treated as an emergency requirement for the purposes of this Act.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Designation in the House of Representatives</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a PAYGO Act includes a provision expressly designated as an emergency for the purposes of this chapter, the Chair shall put the question of consideration with respect thereto.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Point of order in the Senate</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">When the Senate is considering a PAYGO Act, if a point of order is made by a Senator against an emergency designation in that measure, that provision making such a designation shall be stricken from the measure and may not be offered as an amendment from the floor.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Supermajority waiver and appeals</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Waiver</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Subparagraph (A) may be waived or suspended in the Senate only by an affirmative vote of three-fifths of the Members, duly chosen and sworn.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Not later than 14 days (excluding weekends and holidays) after Congress adjourns to end a session, OMB shall make publicly available and cause to be printed in the Federal Register an annual PAYGO report. The report shall include an up-to-date document containing the PAYGO scorecards, a description of any current policy adjustments made under section 933(c) of this title, information about emergency legislation (if any) designated under section 933(g) of this title, information about any sequestration if required by subsection (b), and other data and explanations that enhance public understanding of this chapter and actions taken under it.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">If the annual report issued at the end of a session of Congress under subsection (a) shows a debit on either PAYGO scorecard for the budget year, OMB shall prepare and the President shall issue and include in that report a sequestration order that, upon issuance, shall reduce budgetary resources of direct spending programs by enough to offset that debit as prescribed in section 935 of this title. If there is a debit on both scorecards, the order shall fully offset the larger of the two debits. OMB shall transmit the order and the report to the House of Representatives and the Senate. If the President issues a sequestration order, the annual report shall contain, for each budget account to be sequestered, estimates of the baseline level of budgetary resources subject to sequestration, the amount of budgetary resources to be sequestered, and the outlay reductions that will occur in the budget year and the subsequent fiscal year because of that sequestration.</p>

If the uniform percentage calculated under the prior sentence exceeds 4 percent, the Medicare programs described in section 906(d) of this title shall be reduced by 4 percent and the uniform percentage by which the budgetary resources of all other nonexempt direct spending programs are to be sequestered shall be increased, as necessary, so that the sequestration of Medicare and of all other nonexempt direct spending programs together produce the required outlay savings.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Programs and activities in unified budget only</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to the exemptions set forth in section 11,<sup><a href="#935_1_target" name="935_1">1</a></sup> OMB shall determine the uniform percentage required under paragraph (1) with respect to programs and activities contained in the unified budget only.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Outlay savings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In determining the amount by which a sequestration offsets a budget-year debit, OMB shall count&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the amount by which the sequestration in a crop year of crop support payments, pursuant to section 906(j) of this title, reduces outlays in the budget year and the subsequent fiscal year;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the amount by which the sequestration of Medicare payments in the 12-month period following the sequestration order, pursuant to section 906(d) of this title, reduces outlays in the budget year and the subsequent fiscal year; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the amount by which the sequestration in the budget year of the budgetary resources of other nonexempt mandatory programs reduces outlays in the budget year and in the subsequent fiscal year.</p>
