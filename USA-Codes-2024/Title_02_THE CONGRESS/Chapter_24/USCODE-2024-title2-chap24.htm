<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Prohibiting hearing officer conducting preliminary review from conducting hearing</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Hearing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Unless a claim is dismissed before a hearing, a hearing shall be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) conducted in closed session on the record by the hearing officer;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) commenced no later than 90 days after the Executive Director receives the covered employee's request for the hearing under subsection (a), except that, upon mutual agreement of the parties or for good cause, the Office shall extend the time for commencing a hearing for not more than an additional 30 days; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) conducted, except as specifically provided in this chapter and to the greatest extent practicable, in accordance with the principles and procedures set forth in sections 554 through 557 of title 5.</p>

At the request of the witness or any party, the hearing officer shall (or on the hearing officer's own initiative, the hearing officer may) refer the ruling to the Board for review.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Enforcement</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a person fails to comply with a subpoena, the Board may authorize the General Counsel to apply, in the name of the Office, to an appropriate United States district court for an order requiring that person to appear before the hearing officer to give testimony or produce records. The application may be made within the judicial district where the hearing is conducted or where that person is found, resides, or transacts business. Any failure to obey a lawful order of the district court issued pursuant to this section may be held by such court to be a civil contempt thereof.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Service of process</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Process in an action or contempt proceeding pursuant to subparagraph (A) may be served in any judicial district in which the person refusing or failing to comply, or threatening to refuse or not to comply, resides, transacts business, or may be found, and subpoenas for witnesses who are required to attend such proceedings may run into any other district.</p>

The decision shall be entered in the records of the Office.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Options for employees</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Remote work assignment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">At the request of a covered employee who files a claim alleging a violation of part A of subchapter II by the covered employee's employing office, during the pendency of any of the procedures available under this subchapter for consideration of the claim, the employing office may permit the covered employee to carry out the employee's responsibilities from a remote location (referred to in this section as &quot;permitting a remote work assignment&quot;) where such relocation would have the effect of materially reducing interactions between the covered employee and any person alleged to have committed the violation, instead of from a location of the employing office.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exception for work assignments required to be carried out onsite</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, in the determination of the covered employee's employing office, a covered employee who makes a request under this subsection cannot carry out the employee's responsibilities from a remote location or such relocation would not have the effect described in paragraph (1), the employing office may during the pendency of the procedures described in paragraph (1)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) grant a paid leave of absence to the covered employee;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) permit a remote work assignment and grant a paid leave of absence to the covered employee; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) make another workplace adjustment, or permit a remote work assignment, that would have the effect of reducing interactions between the covered employee and any person alleged to have committed the violation described in paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Ensuring no retaliation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An employing office may not grant a covered employee's request under this subsection in a manner which would constitute a violation of section 1317 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) No impact on vacation or personal leave</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In granting leave for a paid leave of absence under this section, an employing office shall not require the covered employee to substitute, for that leave, any of the accrued paid vacation or personal leave of the covered employee.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Exception for arrangements subject to collective bargaining agreements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subsection (a) does not apply to the extent that it is inconsistent with the terms and conditions of any collective bargaining agreement which is in effect with respect to an employing office.</p>
