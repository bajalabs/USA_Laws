<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Enforcement</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Sequestration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 15 calendar days after Congress adjourns to end a session there shall be a sequestration to eliminate a budget-year breach, if any, within any category.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Eliminating a breach</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each non-exempt account within a category shall be reduced by a dollar amount calculated by multiplying the enacted level of sequestrable budgetary resources in that account at that time by the uniform percentage necessary to eliminate a breach within that category.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Military personnel</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the President uses the authority to exempt any personnel account from sequestration under section 905(f) of this title, each account within subfunctional category 051 (other than those military personnel accounts for which the authority provided under section 905(f) of this title has been exercised) shall be further reduced by a dollar amount calculated by multiplying the enacted level of non-exempt budgetary resources in that account at that time by the uniform percentage necessary to offset the total dollar amount by which outlays are not reduced in military personnel accounts by reason of the use of such authority.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Part-year appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, on the date specified in paragraph (1), there is in effect an Act making or continuing appropriations for part of a fiscal year for any budget account, then the dollar sequestration calculated for that account under paragraphs (2) and (3) shall be subtracted from&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the annualized amount otherwise available by law in that account under that or a subsequent part-year appropriation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) when a full-year appropriation for that account is enacted, from the amount otherwise provided by the full-year appropriation for that account.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Look-back</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, after June 30, an appropriation for the fiscal year in progress is enacted that causes a breach within a category for that year (after taking into account any sequestration of amounts within that category), the discretionary spending limits for that category for the next fiscal year shall be reduced by the amount or amounts of that breach.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Within-session sequestration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If an appropriation for a fiscal year in progress is enacted (after Congress adjourns to end the session for that budget year and before July 1 of that fiscal year) that causes a breach within a category for that year (after taking into account any prior sequestration of amounts within that category), 15 days later there shall be a sequestration to eliminate that breach within that category following the procedures set forth in paragraphs (2) through (4).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Estimates</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) CBO estimates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">As soon as practicable after Congress completes action on any discretionary appropriation, CBO, after consultation with the Committees on the Budget of the House of Representatives and the Senate, shall provide OMB with an estimate of the amount of discretionary new budget authority and outlays for the current year, if any, and the budget year provided by that legislation.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) OMB estimates and explanation of differences</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Not later than 7 calendar days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays) after the date of enactment of any discretionary appropriation, OMB shall transmit a report to the House of Representatives and to the Senate containing both the CBO and OMB estimates of the amount of discretionary new budget authority for the current year, if any, and the budget year provided by that legislation, and an explanation of any difference between the 2 estimates. If during the preparation of the report OMB determines that there is a significant difference between OMB and CBO, OMB shall consult with the Committees on the Budget of the House of Representatives and the Senate regarding that difference and that consultation shall include, to the extent practicable, written communication to those committees that affords such committees the opportunity to comment before the issuance of the report.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Assumptions and guidelines</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">OMB estimates under this paragraph shall be made using current economic and technical assumptions. OMB shall use the OMB estimates transmitted to the Congress under this paragraph. OMB and CBO shall prepare estimates under this paragraph in conformance with scorekeeping guidelines determined after consultation among the Committees on the Budget of the House of Representatives and the Senate, CBO, and OMB.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Annual appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this paragraph, amounts provided by annual appropriations shall include any discretionary appropriations for the current year, if any, and the budget year in accounts for which funding is provided in that legislation that result from previously enacted legislation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Adjustments to discretionary spending limits</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Concepts and definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">When the President submits the budget under section 1105 of title 31, OMB shall calculate and the budget shall include adjustments to discretionary spending limits (and <!-- PDFPage:242 -->those limits as cumulatively adjusted) for the budget year and each outyear to reflect changes in concepts and definitions. Such changes shall equal the baseline levels of new budget authority and outlays using up-to-date concepts and definitions, minus those levels using the concepts and definitions in effect before such changes. Such changes may only be made after consultation with the Committees on Appropriations and the Budget of the House of Representatives and the Senate, and that consultation shall include written communication to such committees that affords such committees the opportunity to comment before official action is taken with respect to such changes.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Sequestration reports</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">When OMB submits a sequestration report under section 904(e), (f), or (g) of this title for a fiscal year, OMB shall calculate, and the sequestration report and subsequent budgets submitted by the President under section 1105(a) of title 31 shall include&#160;<sup><a href="#901_1_target" name="901_1">1</a></sup> adjustments to discretionary spending limits (and those limits as adjusted) for the fiscal year and each succeeding year, as follows:</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of this section is to assure that any legislation enacted before October 1, 2002, affecting direct spending or receipts that increases the deficit will trigger an offsetting sequestration.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Sequestration</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Timing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Not later than 15 calendar days after the date Congress adjourns to end a session and on the same day as a sequestration (if any) under section 901 or 903 of this title, there shall be a sequestration to offset the amount of any net deficit increase caused by all direct spending and receipts legislation enacted before October 1, 2002, as calculated under paragraph (2).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Calculation of deficit increase</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">OMB shall calculate the amount of deficit increase or decrease by adding&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) all OMB estimates for the budget year of direct spending and receipts legislation transmitted under subsection (d);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the estimated amount of savings in direct spending programs applicable to the budget year resulting from the prior year's sequestration under this section or section 903 of this title, if any, as published in OMB's final sequestration report for that prior year; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) any net deficit increase or decrease in the current year resulting from all OMB estimates for the current year of direct spending and receipts legislation transmitted under subsection (d) that were not reflected in the final OMB sequestration report for the current year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Eliminating a deficit increase</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The amount required to be sequestered in a fiscal year under subsection (b) shall be obtained from non-exempt direct spending accounts from actions taken in the following order:</p>
<!-- PDFPage:253 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(A) First</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">All reductions in automatic spending increases specified in section 906(a)&#160;<sup><a href="#902_1_target" name="902_1">1</a></sup> of this title shall be made.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(B) Second</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If additional reductions in direct spending accounts are required to be made, the maximum reductions permissible under sections 906(b) of this title (guaranteed and direct student loans) and 906(c)&#160;<sup><a href="#902_1_target" name="902_1">1</a></sup> of this title (foster care and adoption assistance) shall be made.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(C) Third</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) If additional reductions in direct spending accounts are required to be made, each remaining non-exempt direct spending account shall be reduced by the uniform percentage necessary to make the reductions in direct spending required by subsection (b); except that the medicare programs specified in section 906(d) of this title shall not be reduced by more than 4 percent and the uniform percentage applicable to all other direct spending programs under this paragraph shall be increased (if necessary) to a level sufficient to achieve the required reduction in direct spending.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) For purposes of determining reductions under clause (i), outlay reductions (as a result of sequestration of Commodity Credit Corporation commodity price support contracts in the fiscal year of a sequestration) that would occur in the following fiscal year shall be credited as outlay reductions in the fiscal year of the sequestration.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of this subsection, accounts shall be assumed to be at the level in the baseline.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Estimates</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) CBO estimates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">As soon as practicable after Congress completes action on any direct spending or receipts legislation, CBO shall provide an estimate to OMB of that legislation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) OMB estimates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Not later than 7 calendar days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays) after the date of enactment of any direct spending or receipts legislation, OMB shall transmit a report to the House of Representatives and to the Senate containing&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the CBO estimate of that legislation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) an OMB estimate of that legislation using current economic and technical assumptions; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) an explanation of any difference between the 2 estimates.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Significant differences</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If during the preparation of the report under paragraph (2) OMB determines that there is a significant difference between the OMB and CBO estimates, OMB shall consult with the Committees on the Budget of the House of Representatives and the Senate regarding that difference and that consultation, to the extent practicable, shall include written communication to such committees that affords such committees the opportunity to comment before the issuance of that report.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Scope of estimates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The estimates under this section shall include the amount of change in outlays or receipts for the current year (if applicable), the budget year, and each outyear excluding any amounts resulting from&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) full funding of, and continuation of, the deposit insurance guarantee commitment in effect under current estimates; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) emergency provisions as designated under subsection (e).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Scorekeeping guidelines</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">OMB and CBO, after consultation with each other and the Committees on the Budget of the House of Representatives and the Senate, shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) determine common scorekeeping guidelines; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in conformance with such guidelines, prepare estimates under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Emergency legislation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a provision of direct spending or receipts legislation is enacted that the President designates as an emergency requirement and that the Congress so designates in statute, the amounts of new budget authority, outlays, and receipts in all fiscal years resulting from that provision shall be designated as an emergency requirement in the reports required under subsection (d). This subsection shall not apply to direct spending provisions to cover agricultural crop disaster assistance.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;903. Enforcing deficit targets</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Sequestration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within 15 calendar days after Congress adjourns to end a session (other than of the One Hundred First Congress) and on the same day as a sequestration (if any) under section 901 of this title and section 902 of this title, but after any sequestration required by section 901 of this title (enforcing discretionary spending limits) or section 902 of this title (enforcing pay-as-you-go), there shall be a sequestration to eliminate the excess deficit (if any remains) if it exceeds the margin.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Excess deficit; margin</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The excess deficit is, if greater than zero, the estimated deficit for the budget year, minus&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:255 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the maximum deficit amount for that year;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the amounts for that year designated as emergency direct spending or receipts legislation under section 902(e) of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) for any fiscal year in which there is not a full adjustment for technical and economic reestimates, the deposit insurance reestimate for that year, if any, calculated under subsection (h).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The &quot;margin&quot; for fiscal year 1992 or 1993 is zero and for fiscal year 1994 or 1995 is $15,000,000,000.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Dividing sequestration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To eliminate the excess deficit in a budget year, half of the required outlay reductions shall be obtained from non-exempt defense accounts (accounts designated as function 050 in the President's fiscal year 1991 budget submission) and half from non-exempt, non-defense accounts (all other non-exempt accounts).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Defense</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each non-exempt defense account shall be reduced by a dollar amount calculated by multiplying the level of sequestrable budgetary resources in that account at that time by the uniform percentage necessary to carry out subsection (c), except that, if any military personnel are exempt, adjustments shall be made under the procedure set forth in section 901(a)(3) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Non-defense</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Actions to reduce non-defense accounts shall be taken in the following order:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) First</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">All reductions in automatic spending increases under section 906(a)&#160;<sup><a href="#903_1_target" name="903_1">1</a></sup> of this title shall be made.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Second</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If additional reductions in non-defense accounts are required to be made, the maximum reduction permissible under sections 906(b) of this title (guaranteed student loans) and 906(c)&#160;<sup><a href="#903_1_target" name="903_1">1</a></sup> of this title (foster care and adoption assistance) shall be made.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Third</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) If additional reductions in non-defense accounts are required to be made, each remaining non-exempt, non-defense account shall be reduced by the uniform percentage necessary to make the reductions in non-defense outlays required by subsection (c), except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the medicare program specified in section 906(d) of this title shall not be reduced by more than 2 percent in total including any reduction of less than 2 percent made under section 902 of this title or, if it has been reduced by 2 percent or more under section 902 of this title, it may not be further reduced under this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the health programs set forth in section 906(e) of this title shall not be reduced by more than 2 percent in total (including any reduction made under section 901 of this title),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">and the uniform percent applicable to all other programs under this subsection shall be increased (if necessary) to a level sufficient to achieve the required reduction in non-defense outlays.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) For purposes of determining reductions under subparagraph (A), outlay reduction (as a result of sequestration of Commodity Credit Corporation commodity price support contracts in the fiscal year of a sequestration) that would occur in the following fiscal year shall be credited as outlay reductions in the fiscal year of the sequestration.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Baseline assumptions; part-year appropriations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Budget assumptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of subsections (b), (c), (d), and (e), accounts shall be assumed to be at the level in the baseline minus any reductions required to be made under sections 901 and 902 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Part-year appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, on the date specified in subsection (a), there is in effect an Act making or continuing appropriations for part of a fiscal year for any non-exempt budget account, then the dollar sequestration calculated for that account under subsection (d) or (e), as applicable, shall be subtracted from&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the annualized amount otherwise available by law in that account under that or a subsequent part-year appropriation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) when a full-year appropriation for that account is enacted, from the amount otherwise provided by the full-year appropriation; except that the amount to be sequestered from that account shall be reduced (but not below zero) by the savings achieved by that appropriation when the enacted amount is less than the baseline for that account.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Adjustments to maximum deficit amounts</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Adjustments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) When the President submits the budget for fiscal year 1992, the maximum deficit amounts for fiscal years 1992, 1993, 1994, and 1995 shall be adjusted to reflect up-to-date reestimates of economic and technical assumptions and any changes in concepts or definitions. When the President submits the budget for fiscal year 1993, the maximum deficit amounts for fiscal years 1993, 1994, and 1995 shall be further adjusted to reflect up-to-date reestimates of economic and technical assumptions and any changes in concepts or definitions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) When submitting the budget for fiscal year 1994, the President may choose to adjust the maximum deficit amounts for fiscal years 1994 and 1995 to reflect up-to-date reestimates of economic and technical assumptions. If the President chooses to adjust the maximum deficit amount when submitting the fiscal year 1994 budget, the President may choose to invoke the same adjustment procedure when submitting the budget for fiscal year 1995. In each case, the President must choose between making no adjustment or the full adjustment described in <!-- PDFPage:256 -->paragraph (2). If the President chooses to make that full adjustment, then those procedures for adjusting discretionary spending limits described in sections 901(b)(1)(C)&#160;<sup><a href="#903_1_target" name="903_1">1</a></sup> and 901(b)(2)(E)&#160;<sup><a href="#903_1_target" name="903_1">1</a></sup> of this title, otherwise applicable through fiscal year 1993 or 1994 (as the case may be), shall be deemed to apply for fiscal year 1994 (and 1995 if applicable).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) When the budget for fiscal year 1994 or 1995 is submitted and the sequestration reports for those years under section 904 of this title are made (as applicable), if the President does not choose to make the adjustments set forth in subparagraph (B), the maximum deficit amount for that fiscal year shall be adjusted by the amount of the adjustment to discretionary spending limits first applicable for that year (if any) under section 901(b) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) For each fiscal year the adjustments required to be made with the submission of the President's budget for that year shall also be made when OMB submits the sequestration update report and the final sequestration report for that year, but OMB shall continue to use the economic and technical assumptions in the President's budget for that year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Each adjustment shall be made by increasing or decreasing the maximum deficit amounts set forth in section 665&#160;<sup><a href="#903_1_target" name="903_1">1</a></sup> of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Calculations of adjustments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The required increase or decrease shall be calculated as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The baseline deficit or surplus shall be calculated using up-to-date economic and technical assumptions, using up-to-date concepts and definitions, and, in lieu of the baseline levels of discretionary appropriations, using the discretionary spending limits set forth in section 665&#160;<sup><a href="#903_1_target" name="903_1">1</a></sup> of this title as adjusted under section 901 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The net deficit increase or decrease caused by all direct spending and receipts legislation enacted after November 5, 1990 (after adjusting for any sequestration of direct spending accounts) shall be calculated for each fiscal year by adding&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the estimates of direct spending and receipts legislation transmitted under section 902(d) of this title applicable to each such fiscal year; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the estimated amount of savings in direct spending programs applicable to each such fiscal year resulting from the prior year's sequestration under this section or section 902 of this title of direct spending, if any, as contained in OMB's final sequestration report for that year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) The amount calculated under subparagraph (B) shall be subtracted from the amount calculated under subparagraph (A).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) The maximum deficit amount set forth in section 665&#160;<sup><a href="#903_1_target" name="903_1">1</a></sup> of this title shall be subtracted from the amount calculated under subparagraph (C).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) The amount calculated under subparagraph (D) shall be the amount of the adjustment required by paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Treatment of deposit insurance</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Initial estimates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The initial estimates of the net costs of federal deposit insurance for fiscal year 1994 and fiscal year 1995 (assuming full funding of, and continuation of, the deposit insurance guarantee commitment in effect on the date of the submission of the budget for fiscal year 1993) shall be set forth in that budget.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Reestimates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For fiscal year 1994 and fiscal year 1995, the amount of the reestimate of deposit insurance costs shall be calculated by subtracting the amount set forth under paragraph (1) for that year from the current estimate of deposit insurance costs (but assuming full funding of, and continuation of, the deposit insurance guarantee commitment in effect on the date of submission of the budget for fiscal year 1993).</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;907. The baseline</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For any budget year, the baseline refers to a projection of current-year levels of new budget authority, outlays, revenues, and the surplus or deficit into the budget year and the outyears based on laws enacted through the applicable date.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Direct spending and receipts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the budget year and each outyear, the baseline shall be calculated using the following assumptions:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Laws providing or creating direct spending and receipts are assumed to operate in the manner specified in those laws for each such year and funding for entitlement authority is assumed to be adequate to make all payments required by those laws.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exceptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A)(i) No program established by a law enacted on or before August 5, 1997, with estimated current year outlays greater than $50,000,000 shall be assumed to expire in the budget year or the outyears. The scoring of new programs with estimated outlays greater than $50,000,000 a year shall be based on scoring by the Committees on Budget or OMB, as applicable. OMB, CBO, and the Budget Committees shall consult on the scoring of such programs where there are differences between CBO and OMB.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) On the expiration of the suspension of a provision of law that is suspended under section 7301 of title 7 and that authorizes a program with estimated fiscal year outlays that are greater than $50,000,000, for purposes of clause (i), the program shall be assumed to continue to operate in the same manner as the program operated immediately before the expiration of the suspension.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The increase for veterans&apos; compensation for a fiscal year is assumed to be the same as that required by law for veterans&apos; pensions unless otherwise provided by law enacted in that session.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Excise taxes dedicated to a trust fund, if expiring, are assumed to be extended at current rates.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) If any law expires before the budget year or any outyear, then any program with estimated current year outlays greater than $50,000,000 that operates under that law shall be assumed to continue to operate under that law as in effect immediately before its expiration.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Hospital Insurance Trust Fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the receipts and disbursements of the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund shall be included in all calculations required by this Act.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Discretionary appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the budget year and each outyear, the baseline shall be calculated using the following assumptions regarding all amounts other than those covered by subsection (b):</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Inflation of current-year appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Budgetary resources other than unobligated balances shall be at the level provided for the budget year in full-year appropriation Acts. If for any account a full-year appropriation has not yet been enacted, budgetary resources other than unobligated balances shall be at the level available in the current year, adjusted sequentially and cumulatively for expiring housing contracts as specified in paragraph (2), for social insurance administrative expenses as specified in paragraph (3), to offset pay absorption and for pay annualization as specified in paragraph (4), for inflation as specified in paragraph (5), and to account for changes required by law in the level of agency payments for personnel benefits other than pay.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Expiring housing contracts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">New budget authority to renew expiring multiyear subsidized housing contracts shall be adjusted to reflect the difference in the number of such contracts that are scheduled to expire in that fiscal year and the number expiring in the current year, with the per-contract renewal cost equal to the average current-year cost of renewal contracts.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Social insurance administrative expenses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Budgetary resources for the administrative expenses of the following trust funds shall be adjusted by the percentage change in the beneficiary population from the current year to that fiscal year: the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, the Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund, the Unemployment Trust Fund, and the railroad retirement account.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:276 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Pay annualization; offset to pay absorption</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Current-year new budget authority for Federal employees shall be adjusted to reflect the full 12-month costs (without absorption) of any pay adjustment that occurred in that fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Inflators</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The inflator used in paragraph (1) to adjust budgetary resources relating to personnel shall be the percent by which the average of the Bureau of Labor Statistics Employment Cost Index (wages and salaries, private industry workers) for that fiscal year differs from such index for the current year. The inflator used in paragraph (1) to adjust all other budgetary resources shall be the percent by which the average of the estimated gross domestic product chain-type price index for that fiscal year differs from the average of such estimated index for the current year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Current-year appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, for any account, a continuing appropriation is in effect for less than the entire current year, then the current-year amount shall be assumed to equal the amount that would be available if that continuing appropriation covered the entire fiscal year. If law permits the transfer of budget authority among budget accounts in the current year, the current-year level for an account shall reflect transfers accomplished by the submission of, or assumed for the current year in, the President's original budget for the budget year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Up-to-date concepts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In deriving the baseline for any budget year or outyear, current-year amounts shall be calculated using the concepts and definitions that are required for that budget year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Asset sales</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Amounts realized from the sale of an asset shall not be included in estimates under section 901, 902, or 903 of this title if that sale would result in a financial cost to the Federal Government as determined pursuant to scorekeeping guidelines.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Introduction of joint resolution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">At any time after the Director of OMB issues a final sequestration report under section 904 of this title for a fiscal year, but before the close of the twentieth calendar day of the session of Congress beginning after the date of issuance of such report, the majority leader of either House of Congress may introduce a joint resolution which contains provisions directing the President to modify the most recent order issued under section 904 of this title or provide an alternative to reduce the deficit for such fiscal year. After the introduction of the first such joint resolution in either House of Congress in any calendar year, then no other joint resolution introduced in such House in such calendar year shall be subject to the procedures set forth in this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Procedures for consideration of joint resolutions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Referral to committee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A joint resolution introduced in the Senate under subsection (a) shall not be referred to a committee of the Senate and shall be placed on the calendar pending disposition of such joint resolution in accordance with this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Consideration in Senate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">On or after the third calendar day (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays) beginning after a joint resolution is introduced under subsection (a), notwithstanding any rule or precedent of the Senate, including Rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, it is in order (even though a previous motion to the same effect has been disagreed to) for any Member of the Senate to move to proceed to the consideration of the joint resolution. The motion is not in order after the eighth calendar day (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays) beginning after a joint resolu<!-- PDFPage:279 -->tion (to which the motion applies) is introduced. The joint resolution is privileged in the Senate. A motion to reconsider the vote by which the motion is agreed to or disagreed to shall not be in order. If a motion to proceed to the consideration of the joint resolution is agreed to, the Senate shall immediately proceed to consideration of the joint resolution without intervening motion, order, or other business, and the joint resolution shall remain the unfinished business of the Senate until disposed of.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Debate in Senate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) In the Senate, debate on a joint resolution introduced under subsection (a), amendments thereto, and all debatable motions and appeals in connection therewith shall be limited to not more than 10 hours, which shall be divided equally between the majority leader and the minority leader (or their designees).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) A motion to postpone, or a motion to proceed to the consideration of other business is not in order. A motion to reconsider the vote by which the joint resolution is agreed to or disagreed to is not in order, and a motion to recommit the joint resolution is not in order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C)(i) No amendment that is not germane to the provisions of the joint resolution or to the order issued under section 904 of this title shall be in order in the Senate. In the Senate, an amendment, any amendment to an amendment, or any debatable motion or appeal is debatable for not to exceed 30 minutes to be equally divided between, and controlled by, the mover and the majority leader (or their designees), except that in the event that the majority leader favors the amendment, motion, or appeal, the minority leader (or the minority leader's designee) shall control the time in opposition to the amendment, motion, or appeal.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) In the Senate, an amendment that is otherwise in order shall be in order notwithstanding the fact that it amends the joint resolution in more than one place or amends language previously amended. It shall not be in order in the Senate to vote on the question of agreeing to such a joint resolution or any amendment thereto unless the figures then contained in such joint resolution or amendment are mathematically consistent.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Vote on final passage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Immediately following the conclusion of the debate on a joint resolution introduced under subsection (a), a single quorum call at the conclusion of the debate if requested in accordance with the rules of the Senate, and the disposition of any pending amendments under paragraph (3), the vote on final passage of the joint resolution shall occur.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Appeals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Appeals from the decisions of the Chair shall be decided without debate.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Conference reports</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Resolution from other House</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, before the passage by the Senate of a joint resolution of the Senate introduced under subsection (a), the Senate receives from the House of Representatives a joint resolution introduced under subsection (a), then the following procedures shall apply:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The joint resolution of the House of Representatives shall not be referred to a committee and shall be placed on the calendar.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) With respect to a joint resolution introduced under subsection (a) in the Senate&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the procedure in the Senate shall be the same as if no joint resolution had been received from the House; but</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii)(I) the vote on final passage shall be on the joint resolution of the House if it is identical to the joint resolution then pending for passage in the Senate; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) if the joint resolution from the House is not identical to the joint resolution then pending for passage in the Senate and the Senate then passes the Senate joint resolution, the Senate shall be considered to have passed the House joint resolution as amended by the text of the Senate joint resolution.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Upon disposition of the joint resolution received from the House, it shall no longer be in order to consider the resolution originated in the Senate.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Senate action on House resolution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Senate receives from the House of Representatives a joint resolution introduced under subsection (a) after the Senate has disposed of a Senate originated resolution which is identical to the House passed joint resolution, the action of the Senate with regard to the disposition of the Senate originated joint resolution shall be deemed to be the action of the Senate with regard to the House originated joint resolution. If it is not identical to the House passed joint resolution, then the Senate shall be considered to have passed the joint resolution of the House as amended by the text of the Senate joint resolution.</p>

To the extent such additional reductions are made and result in additional outlay reductions, the President may provide for lesser reductions in new budget authority and unobligated balances for other programs, projects, or activities within major functional category 050 for such fiscal year, but only to the extent that the resulting outlay increases do not exceed the additional outlay reductions, and no such program, project, or activity may be increased above the level actually made available by law in appropriation Acts (before taking sequestration into account). In making calculations under this subsection, the President shall use account outlay rates that are identical to those used in the report by the Director of OMB under section 904 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Base closures prohibited</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No actions taken by the President under subsection (a) for a fiscal year may result in a domestic base closure or realignment that would otherwise be subject to section 2687 of title 10.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The President may not exercise the authority provided by this paragraph&#160;<sup><a href="#907c_1_target" name="907c_1">1</a></sup> for a fiscal year unless&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Reporting of resolutions and reconciliation bills and resolutions, in Senate</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Committee alternatives to Presidential order</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">After the submission of an OMB sequestration update report under section 904 of this title that envisions a sequestration under section 902 or 903 of this title, each standing committee of the Senate may, not later than October 10, submit to the Committee on the Budget of the Senate information of the type de<!-- PDFPage:282 -->scribed in section 632(d) of this title with respect to alternatives to the order envisioned by such report insofar as such order affects laws within the jurisdiction of the committee.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Initial Budget Committee action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">After the submission of such a report, the Committee on the Budget of the Senate may, not later than October 15, report to the Senate a resolution. The resolution may affirm the impact of the order envisioned by such report, in whole or in part. To the extent that any part is not affirmed, the resolution shall state which parts are not affirmed and shall contain instructions to committees of the Senate of the type referred to in section 641(a) of this title, sufficient to achieve at least the total level of deficit reduction contained in those sections which are not affirmed.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Response of committees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Committees instructed pursuant to paragraph (2), or affected thereby, shall submit their responses to the Budget Committee no later than 10 days after the resolution referred to in paragraph (2) is agreed to, except that if only one such Committee is so instructed such Committee shall, by the same date, report to the Senate a reconciliation bill or reconciliation resolution containing its recommendations in response to such instructions. A committee shall be considered to have complied with all instructions to it pursuant to a resolution adopted under paragraph (2) if it has made recommendations with respect to matters within its jurisdiction which would result in a reduction in the deficit at least equal to the total reduction directed by such instructions.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Budget Committee action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Upon receipt of the recommendations received in response to a resolution referred to in paragraph (2), the Budget Committee shall report to the Senate a reconciliation bill or reconciliation resolution, or both, carrying out all such recommendations without any substantive revisions. In the event that a committee instructed in a resolution referred to in paragraph (2) fails to submit any recommendation (or, when only one committee is instructed, fails to report a reconciliation bill or resolution) in response to such instructions, the Budget Committee shall include in the reconciliation bill or reconciliation resolution reported pursuant to this subparagraph legislative language within the jurisdiction of the noncomplying committee to achieve the amount of deficit reduction directed in such instructions.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Point of order</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">It shall not be in order in the Senate to consider any reconciliation bill or reconciliation resolution reported under paragraph (4) with respect to a fiscal year, any amendment thereto, or any conference report thereon if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the enactment of such bill or resolution as reported;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the adoption and enactment of such amendment; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the enactment of such bill or resolution in the form recommended in such conference report,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">would cause the amount of the deficit for such fiscal year to exceed the maximum deficit amount for such fiscal year, unless the low-growth report submitted under section 904 of this title projects negative real economic growth for such fiscal year, or for each of any two consecutive quarters during such fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Treatment of certain amendments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the Senate, an amendment which adds to a resolution reported under paragraph (2) an instruction of the type referred to in such paragraph shall be in order during the consideration of such resolution if such amendment would be in order but for the fact that it would be held to be non-germane on the basis that the instruction constitutes new matter.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) &quot;Day&quot; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraphs (1), (2), and (3), the term &quot;day&quot; shall mean any calendar day on which the Senate is in session.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Procedures</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (2), in the Senate the provisions of sections 636 and 641 of this title for the consideration of concurrent resolutions on the budget and conference reports thereon shall also apply to the consideration of resolutions, and reconciliation bills and reconciliation resolutions reported under this paragraph and conference reports thereon.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Limit on debate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Debate in the Senate on any resolution reported pursuant to subsection (a)(2), and all amendments thereto and debatable motions and appeals in connection therewith, shall be limited to 10 hours.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Limitation on amendments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Section 641(d)(2) of this title shall apply to reconciliation bills and reconciliation resolutions reported under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Bills and resolutions received from the House</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any bill or resolution received in the Senate from the House, which is a companion to a reconciliation bill or reconciliation resolution of the Senate for the purposes of this subsection, shall be considered in the Senate pursuant to the provisions of this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) &quot;Resolution&quot; defined</h4>
