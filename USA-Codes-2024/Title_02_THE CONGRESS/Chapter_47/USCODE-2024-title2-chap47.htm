<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the term &quot;relative&quot; has the same meaning given to such term in section 13101(16) of title 5.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If a Member, officer, or employee, after exercising reasonable diligence to obtain the information necessary to comply with this rule, unknowingly accepts a gift described in paragraph (1) such Member, officer, or employee shall, upon learning of the nature of the gift and its source, return the gift or, if it is not possible to return the gift, reimburse the donor for the value of the gift.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, a Member, officer, or employee of the Senate may participate in a program, the principal objective of which is educational, sponsored by a foreign government or a foreign educational or charitable organization involving travel to a foreign country paid for by that foreign government or organization if such participation is not in violation of any law and if the select&#160;<sup><a href="#4725_2_target" name="4725_2">2</a></sup> Committee on Ethics has determined that participation in such program by Members, officers, or employees of the Senate is in the interests of the Senate and the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Any Member who accepts an invitation to participate in any such program shall notify the Select Committee in writing of his acceptance. A Member shall also notify the Select Committee in writing whenever he has permitted any officer or employee whom he supervises to participate in any such program.

Necessary expenses do not include the provision of food, lodging, or transportation, or the payment for such expenses, for a continuous <!-- PDFPage:581 -->period in excess of 3 days exclusive of travel time within the United States or 7 days exclusive of travel time outside of the United States unless such travel is approved by the Committee on Ethics as necessary for participation in a conference, seminar, meeting or similar matter.
