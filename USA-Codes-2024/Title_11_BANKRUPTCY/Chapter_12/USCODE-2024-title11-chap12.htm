<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) include any other appropriate provision not inconsistent with this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Except as provided in subsections (b)(5) and (b)(9), the plan may not provide for payments over a period that is longer than three years unless the court for cause approves a longer period, but the court may not approve a period that is longer than five years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Notwithstanding subsection (b)(2) of this section and sections 506(b) and 1225(a)(5) of this title, if it is proposed in a plan to cure a default, the amount necessary to cure the default, shall be determined in accordance with the underlying agreement and applicable nonbankruptcy law.</p>
