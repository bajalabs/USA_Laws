The transfer process for policies for the 1997 crop year with sales closing dates before January 1, 1997, shall begin at the time of the Secretary's announcement under clause (iii) and be completed by the sales closing date for the crop and county. The transfer process for all subsequent policies (including policies for the 1998 and subsequent crop years) shall begin at a date that permits the process to be completed not later than 45 days before the sales closing date.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">If State law permits a licensing fee to be paid by an insurance provider to a cooperative association or trade association and rebated to a producer through the payment of catastrophic risk protection administrative fees, a cooperative association or trade association located in that State may pay, on behalf of a member of the association in that State or a contiguous State who consents to be insured under such an arrangement, all or a portion of the administrative fee required by this paragraph for catastrophic risk protection.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Selection of provider</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Nothing in this subparagraph limits the option of a producer to select the licensed insurance agent or other approved insurance provider from whom the producer will purchase a policy or plan of insurance or to refuse coverage for which a payment is offered to be made under clause (i).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Delivery of insurance</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Time for payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The administrative fee required by this paragraph shall be paid by the producer on the same date on which the premium for a policy of additional coverage would be paid by the producer.</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Participation requirement</h4>

On enactment of such Act, a producer who made timely purchases of a crop insurance policy before the date of enactment of such Act, under the provisions of this subchapter then in effect, shall be eligible for the same benefits to which a producer would be entitled under comparable additional coverage under subsection (c).</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Second crop</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &quot;second crop&quot; means a second crop of the same agricultural commodity as the first crop, or a crop of a different agricultural commodity following the first crop, planted on the same acreage as the first crop for harvest in the same crop year, except the term does not include a replanted crop.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Replanted crop</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &quot;replanted crop&quot; means any agricultural commodity replanted on the same acreage as the first crop for harvest in the same crop year if the replanting is required by the terms of the policy of insurance covering the first crop.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Double insurance</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Options on loss to first crop</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in subsections (d) and (e), if a first crop insured under this subchapter in a crop year has a total or partial insurable loss, the producer of the first crop may elect one of the following options:</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) No second crop planted</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The producer may&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Effect of no loss to second crop</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a producer makes an election under paragraph (1)(B) and the producer does not suffer an insurable loss to the second crop, the producer may collect an indemnity payment for the first crop that is equal to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) 100 percent of the insurable loss for the first crop; less</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the amount previously collected under paragraph (1)(B)(ii).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Premium for first crop if second crop planted</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Initial premium</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a producer makes an election under paragraph (1)(B), the producer shall be responsible for a premium for the first crop <!-- PDFPage:838 -->that is commensurate with the indemnity paid under paragraph (1)(B)(ii). The Corporation shall adjust the total premium for the first crop to reflect the reduced indemnity.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Effect of no loss to second crop</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the producer makes an election under paragraph (1)(B) and the producer does not suffer an insurable loss to the second crop, the producer shall be responsible for a premium for the first crop that is equal to&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the amount of premium previously paid under subparagraph (A).</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Effect on actual production history</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except in the case of double cropping described in subsection (d), if a producer make an election under paragraph (1)(B) for a crop year, the Corporation shall assign the producer a recorded yield for that crop year for the first crop equal to 60 percent of the producer's actual production history for the agricultural commodity involved, for purposes of determining the producer's actual production history for subsequent crop years.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Area conditions required for payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Corporation shall limit prevented planting payments for producers to those situations in which other producers, in the area where a first crop is prevented from being planted is located, are also generally affected by the conditions that prevented the first crop from being planted.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Planting date</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a producer plants the second crop before the latest planting date established by the Corporation for the first crop, the Corporation shall not make a prevented planting payment with regard to the first crop.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Exception for established double cropping practices</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A producer may receive full indemnity payments on two or more crops planted for harvest in the same crop year and insured under this subchapter if each of the following conditions are met:</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Subsequent crops</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except in the case of double cropping described in subsection (d), if a producer elects to plant a crop (other than a replanted crop) subsequent to a second crop on the same acreage as the first crop and second crop for harvest in the same crop year, the producer shall not be eligible for insurance under this subchapter, or noninsured crop assistance under section 7333 of this title, for the subsequent crop.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Availability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Beginning not later than the 2015 crop of upland cotton, the Corporation shall make available to producers of upland cotton an additional policy (to be known as the &quot;Stacked Income Protection Plan&quot;), which shall provide coverage consistent with the Group Risk Income Protection Plan (and the associated Harvest Revenue Option Endorsement) offered by the Corporation for the 2011 crop year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Required terms</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Corporation may modify the Stacked Income Protection Plan on a program-wide basis, except that the Stacked Income Protection Plan shall comply with the following requirements:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Provide coverage for revenue loss of not less than 10 percent and not more than 30 percent of expected county revenue, specified in increments of 5 percent. The deductible shall be the minimum percent of revenue loss at which indemnities are triggered under the plan, not to be less than 10 percent of the expected county revenue.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Be offered to producers of upland cotton in all counties with upland cotton production&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) at a county-wide level to the fullest extent practicable; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in counties that lack sufficient data, on the basis of such larger geographical area as the Corporation determines to provide sufficient data for purposes of providing the coverage.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Be purchased in addition to any other individual or area coverage in effect on the producer's acreage or as a stand-alone policy, except that if a producer has an individual or area coverage for the same acreage, the maximum coverage available under the Stacked Income Protection Plan shall not exceed the deductible for the individual or area coverage.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Establish coverage based on&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the expected price established under existing Group Risk Income Protection or area wide policy offered by the Corporation for the applicable county (or area) and crop year; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) an expected county yield that is the higher of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the expected county yield established for the existing area-wide plans offered by the Corporation for the applicable county (or area) and crop year (or, in geographic areas where area-wide plans are not offered, an expected yield determined in a manner consistent with those of area-wide plans); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the average of the applicable yield data for the county (or area) for the most recent 5 years, excluding the highest and lowest observations, from the Risk Management Agency or the National Agricultural Statistics Service (or both) or, if sufficient county data is not available, such other data considered appropriate by the Secretary.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Use a multiplier factor to establish maximum protection per acre (referred to as a &quot;protection factor&quot;) of not less than the higher of the level established on a program wide basis or 120 percent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Pay an indemnity based on the amount that the expected county revenue exceeds the actual county revenue, as applied to the individual coverage of the producer. Indemnities under the Stacked Income Protection Plan shall not include or overlap the amount of the deductible selected under paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) In all counties for which data are available, establish separate coverage levels for irrigated and nonirrigated practices.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Premium</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding section 1508(d) of this title, the premium for the Stacked Income Protection Plan shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) be sufficient to cover anticipated losses and a reasonable reserve; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) include an amount for operating and administrative expenses established in accordance with section 1508(k)(4)(F) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Payment of portion of premium by corporation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to section 1508(e)(4) of this title, the amount of premium paid by the Corporation for all qualifying coverage levels of the Stacked Income Protection Plan shall be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) 80 percent of the amount of the premium established under subsection (c) for the coverage level selected; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the amount determined under subsection (c)(2), subject to section 1508(k)(4)(F) of this title, for the coverage to cover administrative and operating expenses.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Relation to other coverages</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Stacked Income Protection Plan is in addition to all other coverages available to producers of upland cotton.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Limitation</h4>
