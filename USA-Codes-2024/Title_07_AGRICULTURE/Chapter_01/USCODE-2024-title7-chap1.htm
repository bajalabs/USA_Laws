<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Required considerations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In determining whether to exempt foreign exchange swaps and foreign exchange forwards from the definition of the term &quot;swap&quot;, the Secretary of the Treasury (referred to in this section as the &quot;Secretary&quot;) shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) whether the required trading and clearing of foreign exchange swaps and foreign exchange forwards would create systemic risk, lower transparency, or threaten the financial stability of the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) whether foreign exchange swaps and foreign exchange forwards are already subject to a regulatory scheme that is materially comparable to that established by this chapter for other classes of swaps;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the extent to which bank regulators of participants in the foreign exchange market provide adequate supervision, including capital and margin requirements;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the extent of adequate payment and settlement systems; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the use of a potential exemption of foreign exchange swaps and foreign exchange forwards to evade otherwise applicable regulatory requirements.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Secretary makes a determination to exempt foreign exchange swaps and foreign exchange forwards from the definition of the term &quot;swap&quot;, the Secretary shall submit to the appropriate committees of Congress a determination that contains&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) an explanation regarding why foreign exchange swaps and foreign exchange forwards are qualitatively different from other classes of swaps in a way that would make the foreign exchange swaps and foreign exchange forwards ill-suited for regulation as swaps; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) an identification of the objective differences of foreign exchange swaps and foreign exchange forwards with respect to standard swaps that warrant an exempted status.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Effect of determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A determination by the Secretary under subsection (b) shall not exempt any foreign exchange swaps and foreign exchange forwards traded on a designated contract market or swap execution facility from any applicable antifraud and antimanipulation provision under this chapter.<sup><a href="#1b_1_target" name="1b_1">1</a></sup></p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Jurisdiction of Commission</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Commission shall have exclusive jurisdiction, except to the extent otherwise provided in the Wall Street Transparency and Accountability Act of 2010 (including an amendment made by that Act) and subparagraphs (C), (D), and (I) of this paragraph and subsections (c) and (f), with respect to accounts, agreements (including any transaction which is of the character of, or is commonly known to the trade as, an &quot;option&quot;, &quot;privilege&quot;, &quot;indemnity&quot;, &quot;bid&quot;, &quot;offer&quot;, &quot;put&quot;, &quot;call&quot;, &quot;advance guaranty&quot;, or &quot;decline guaranty&quot;), and transactions involving swaps or contracts of sale of a commodity for future delivery (including significant price discovery contracts), traded or executed on a contract market designated pursuant to section 7 of this title or a swap execution facility pursuant to section 7b&ndash;3 of this title or any other board of trade, exchange, or market, and transactions subject to regulation by the Commission pursuant to section 23 of this title. Except as hereinabove provided, nothing contained in this section shall (I) supersede or limit the jurisdiction at any time conferred on the Securities and Exchange Commission or other regulatory authorities under the laws of the United States or of any State, or (II) restrict the Securities and Exchange Commission and such other authorities from carrying out their duties and responsibilities in accordance with such laws. Nothing in this section shall supersede or limit the jurisdiction conferred on courts of the United States or any State.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Liability of principal for act of agent</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The act, omission, or failure of any official, agent, or other person acting for any individual, association, partnership, corporation, or trust within the scope of his employment or office shall be deemed the act, omission, or failure of such individual, association, partnership, corporation, or trust, as well as of such official, agent, or other person.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Designation of boards of trade as contract markets; contracts for future delivery; security futures products; filing with Board of Governors of Federal Reserve System; judicial review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding any other provision of law&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i)(I) Except as provided in subclause (II), this chapter shall not apply to and the Commission shall have no jurisdiction to designate a board of trade as a contract market for any transaction whereby any party to such transaction acquires any put, call, or other option on one or more securities (as defined in section 77b(1)&#160;<sup><a href="#2_1_target" name="2_1">1</a></sup> of title 15 or section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 [15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(10)] on January 11, 1983), including any group or index of such securities, or any interest therein or based on the value thereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) This chapter shall apply to and the Commission shall have jurisdiction with respect to accounts, agreements, and transactions involving, and may permit the listing for trading pursuant to section 7a&ndash;2(c) of this title of, a put, call, or other option on 1 or more securities (as defined in section 77b(a)(1) of title 15 or section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 [15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(10)] on January 11, 1983), including any group or index of such securities, or any interest therein or based on the value thereof, that is exempted by the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to section 36(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 [15 U.S.C. 78mm(a)(1)] with the condition that the Commission exercise concurrent jurisdiction over such put, call, or other option; provided, however, that nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to affect the jurisdiction and authority of the Securities and Exchange Commission over such put, call, or other option.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) This chapter shall apply to and the Commission shall have exclusive jurisdiction with respect to accounts, agreements (including any transaction which is of the character of, or is commonly known to the trade as, an &quot;option&quot;, &quot;privilege&quot;, &quot;indemnity&quot;, &quot;bid&quot;, &quot;offer&quot;, &quot;put&quot;, &quot;call&quot;, &quot;advance guaranty&quot;, or &quot;decline guaranty&quot;) and transactions involving, and may designate a board of trade as a contract market in, or register a derivatives transaction execution facility that trades or executes, contracts of sale (or options on such contracts) for future delivery of a group or index of securities (or any interest therein or based upon the value thereof): <i>Provided, however</i>, That no board of <!-- PDFPage:22 -->trade shall be designated as a contract market with respect to any such contracts of sale (or options on such contracts) for future delivery, and no derivatives transaction execution facility shall trade or execute such contracts of sale (or options on such contracts) for future delivery, unless the board of trade or the derivatives transaction execution facility, and the applicable contract, meet the following minimum requirements:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) Settlement of or delivery on such contract (or option on such contract) shall be effected in cash or by means other than the transfer or receipt of any security, except an exempted security under section 77c of title 15 or section 3(a)(12) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 [15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(12)] as in effect on January 11, 1983, (other than any municipal security, as defined in section 3(a)(29) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 [15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(29)] on January 11, 1983);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) Trading in such contract (or option on such contract) shall not be readily susceptible to manipulation of the price of such contract (or option on such contract), nor to causing or being used in the manipulation of the price of any underlying security, option on such security or option on a group or index including such securities; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) Such group or index of securities shall not constitute a narrow-based security index.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) If, in its discretion, the Commission determines that a stock index futures contract, notwithstanding its conformance with the requirements in clause (ii) of this subparagraph, can reasonably be used as a surrogate for trading a security (including a security futures product), it may, by order, require such contract and any option thereon be traded and regulated as security futures products as defined in section 3(a)(56) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 [15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(56)] and section 1a of this title subject to all rules and regulations applicable to security futures products under this chapter and the securities laws as defined in section 3(a)(47) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 [15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(47)].</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) No person shall offer to enter into, enter into, or confirm the execution of any contract of sale (or option on such contract) for future delivery of any security, or interest therein or based on the value thereof, except an exempted security under or&#160;<sup><a href="#2_2_target" name="2_2">2</a></sup> section 3(a)(12) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 [15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(12)] as in effect on January 11, 1983 (other than any municipal security as defined in section 3(a)(29) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 [15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(29)] on January 11, 1983), or except as provided in clause (ii) of this subparagraph or subparagraph (D), any group or index of such securities or any interest therein or based on the value thereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v)(I) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, any contract market in a stock index futures contract (or option thereon) other than a security futures product, or any derivatives transaction execution facility on which such contract or option is traded, shall file with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System any rule establishing or changing the levels of margin (initial and maintenance) for such stock index futures contract (or option thereon) other than security futures products.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) The Board may at any time request any contract market or derivatives transaction execution facility to set the margin for any stock index futures contract (or option thereon), other than for any security futures product, at such levels as the Board in its judgment determines are appropriate to preserve the financial integrity of the contract market or derivatives transaction execution facility, or its clearing system, or to prevent systemic risk. If the contract market or derivatives transaction execution facility fails to do so within the time specified by the Board in its request, the Board may direct the contract market or derivatives transaction execution facility to alter or supplement the rules of the contract market or derivatives transaction execution facility as specified in the request.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(III) Subject to such conditions as the Board may determine, the Board may delegate any or all of its authority, relating to margin for any stock index futures contract (or option thereon), other than security futures products, under this clause to the Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(IV) It shall be unlawful for any futures commission merchant to, directly or indirectly, extend or maintain credit to or for, or collect margin from any customer on any security futures product unless such activities comply with the regulations prescribed pursuant to section 7(c)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 [15 U.S.C. 78g(c)(2)(B)].</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(V) Nothing in this clause shall supersede or limit the authority granted to the Commission in section 12a(9) of this title to direct a contract market or registered derivatives transaction execution facility, on finding an emergency to exist, to raise temporary margin levels on any futures contract, or option on the contract covered by this clause, or on any security futures product.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(VI) Any action taken by the Board, or by the Commission acting under the delegation of authority under subclause III,<sup><a href="#2_3_target" name="2_3">3</a></sup> under this clause directing a contract market to alter or supplement a contract market rule shall be subject to review only in the Court of Appeals where the party seek<!-- PDFPage:23 -->ing review resides or has its principal place of business, or in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The review shall be based on the examination of all information before the Board or the Commission, as the case may be, at the time the determination was made. The court reviewing the action of the Board or the Commission shall not enter a stay or order of mandamus unless the court has determined, after notice and a hearing before a panel of the court, that the agency action complained of was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Jurisdiction and authority of Securities and Exchange Commission over security futures; requirements for security futures trading; periodic or special examinations by Commission representatives</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the Securities and Exchange Commission shall have jurisdiction and authority over security futures as defined in section 3(a)(55) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 [15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(55)], section 77b(a)(16) of title 15, section 80a&ndash;2(a)(52) of title 15, and section 80b&ndash;2(a)(27) of title 15, options on security futures, and persons effecting transactions in security futures and options thereon, and this chapter shall apply to and the Commission shall have jurisdiction with respect to accounts, agreements (including any transaction which is of the character of, or is commonly known to the trade as, an &quot;option&quot;, &quot;privilege&quot;, &quot;indemnity&quot;, &quot;bid&quot;, &quot;offer&quot;, &quot;put&quot;, &quot;call&quot;, &quot;advance guaranty&quot;, or &quot;decline guaranty&quot;), contracts, and transactions involving, and may designate a board of trade as a contract market in, or register a derivatives transaction execution facility that trades or executes, a security futures product as defined in section 1a of this title: <i>Provided, however,</i> That, except as provided in clause (vi) of this subparagraph, no board of trade shall be designated as a contract market with respect to, or registered as a derivatives transaction execution facility for, any such contracts of sale for future delivery unless the board of trade and the applicable contract meet the following criteria:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) Except as otherwise provided in a rule, regulation, or order issued pursuant to clause (v) of this subparagraph, any security underlying the security future, including each component security of a narrow-based security index, is registered pursuant to section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 [15 U.S.C. 78l].</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) If the security futures product is not cash settled, the board of trade on which the security futures product is traded has arrangements in place with a clearing agency registered pursuant to section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 [15 U.S.C. 78q&ndash;1] for the payment and delivery of the securities underlying the security futures product.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(III) Except as otherwise provided in a rule, regulation, or order issued pursuant to clause (v) of this subparagraph, the security future is based upon common stock and such other equity securities as the Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission jointly determine appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(IV) The security futures product is cleared by a clearing agency that has in place provisions for linked and coordinated clearing with other clearing agencies that clear security futures products, which permits the security futures product to be purchased on a designated contract market, registered derivatives transaction execution facility, national securities exchange registered under section 6(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 [15 U.S.C. 78f(a)], or national securities association registered pursuant to section 15A(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 [15 U.S.C. 78o&ndash;3(a)] and offset on another designated contract market, registered derivatives transaction execution facility, national securities exchange registered under section 6(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or national securities association registered pursuant to section 15A(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(V) Only futures commission merchants, introducing brokers, commodity trading advisors, commodity pool operators or associated persons subject to suitability rules comparable to those of a national securities association registered pursuant to section 15A(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 [15 U.S.C. 78o&ndash;3(a)] solicit, accept any order for, or otherwise deal in any transaction in or in connection with the security futures product.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(VI) The security futures product is subject to a prohibition against dual trading in section 6j of this title and the rules and regulations thereunder or the provisions of section 11(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 [15 U.S.C. 78k(a)] and the rules and regulations thereunder, except to the extent otherwise permitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 [15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.] and the rules and regulations thereunder.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(VII) Trading in the security futures product is not readily susceptible to manipulation of the price of such security futures product, nor to causing or being used in the manipulation of the price of any underlying security, option on such security, or option on a group or index including such securities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(VIII) The board of trade on which the security futures product is traded has procedures in place for coordinated surveillance among such board of trade, any market on which any security underlying the security futures product is traded, and other markets on which any related security is traded to detect manipulation and insider trading, except that, if the board of trade is an alternative trading system, a national securities association registered pursuant to section 15A(a) of the Securi<!-- PDFPage:24 -->ties Exchange Act of 1934 [15 U.S.C. 78o&ndash;3(a)] or national securities exchange registered pursuant to section 6(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 [15 U.S.C. 78f(a)] of which such alternative trading system is a member has in place such procedures.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(IX) The board of trade on which the security futures product is traded has in place audit trails necessary or appropriate to facilitate the coordinated surveillance required in subclause (VIII), except that, if the board of trade is an alternative trading system, a national securities association registered pursuant to section 15A(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 [15 U.S.C. 78o&ndash;3(a)] or national securities exchange registered pursuant to section 6(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 [15 U.S.C. 78f(a)] of which such alternative trading system is a member has rules to require such audit trails.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(X) The board of trade on which the security futures product is traded has in place procedures to coordinate trading halts between such board of trade and markets on which any security underlying the security futures product is traded and other markets on which any related security is traded, except that, if the board of trade is an alternative trading system, a national securities association registered pursuant to section 15A(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 [15 U.S.C. 78o&ndash;3(a)] or national securities exchange registered pursuant to section 6(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 [15 U.S.C. 78f(a)] of which such alternative trading system is a member has rules to require such coordinated trading halts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(XI) The margin requirements for a security futures product comply with the regulations prescribed pursuant to section 7(c)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 [15 U.S.C. 78g(c)(2)(B)], except that nothing in this subclause shall be construed to prevent a board of trade from requiring higher margin levels for a security futures product when it deems such action to be necessary or appropriate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) It shall be unlawful for any person to offer, to enter into, to execute, to confirm the execution of, or to conduct any office or business anywhere in the United States, its territories or possessions, for the purpose of soliciting, or accepting any order for, or otherwise dealing in, any transaction in, or in connection with, a security futures product unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) the transaction is conducted on or subject to the rules of a board of trade that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(aa) has been designated by the Commission as a contract market in such security futures product; or</p>

<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body">The transactions subject to this chapter are entered into regularly in interstate and inter<!-- PDFPage:44 -->national commerce and are affected with a national public interest by providing a means for managing and assuming price risks, discovering prices, or disseminating pricing information through trading in liquid, fair and financially secure trading facilities.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the purpose of this chapter to serve the public interests described in subsection (a) through a system of effective self-regulation of trading facilities, clearing systems, market participants and market professionals under the oversight of the Commission. To foster these public interests, it is further the purpose of this chapter to deter and prevent price manipulation or any other disruptions to market integrity; to ensure the financial integrity of all transactions subject to this chapter and the avoidance of systemic risk; to protect all market participants from fraudulent or other abusive sales practices and misuses of customer assets; and to promote responsible innovation and fair competition among boards of trade, other markets and market participants.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Restriction on futures trading</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Unless exempted by the Commission pursuant to subsection (c) or by subsection (e), it shall be unlawful for any person to offer to enter into, to enter into, to execute, to confirm the execution of, or to conduct any office or business anywhere in the United States, its territories or possessions, for the purpose of soliciting or accepting any order for, or otherwise dealing in, any transaction in, or in connection with, a contract for the purchase or sale of a commodity for future delivery (other than a contract which is made on or subject to the rules of a board of trade, exchange, or market located outside the United States, its territories or possessions) unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) such transaction is conducted on or subject to the rules of a board of trade which has been designated or registered by the Commission as a contract market or derivatives transaction execution facility for such commodity;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) such contract is executed or consummated by or through a contract market; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) such contract is evidenced by a record in writing which shows the date, the parties to such contract and their addresses, the property covered and its price, and the terms of delivery: <i>Provided</i>, That each contract market or derivatives transaction execution facility member shall keep such record for a period of three years from the date thereof, or for a longer period if the Commission shall so direct, which record shall at all times be open to the inspection of any representative of the Commission or the Department of Justice.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Regulation of foreign transactions by United States persons</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Foreign boards of trade</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Registration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Commission may adopt rules and regulations requiring registration with the Commission for a foreign board of trade that provides the members of the foreign board of trade or other participants located in the United States with direct access to the electronic trading and order matching system of the foreign board of trade, including rules and regulations prescribing procedures and requirements applicable to the registration of such foreign boards of trade. For purposes of this paragraph, &quot;direct access&quot; refers to an explicit grant of authority by a foreign board of trade to an identified member or other participant located in the United States to enter trades directly into the trade matching system of the foreign board of trade. In adopting such rules and regulations, the commission&#160;<sup><a href="#6_1_target" name="6_1">1</a></sup> shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) whether any such foreign board of trade is subject to comparable, comprehensive supervision and regulation by the appropriate governmental authorities in the foreign board of trade's home country; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) any previous commission&#160;<sup><a href="#6_1_target" name="6_1">1</a></sup> findings that the foreign board of trade is subject to comparable comprehensive supervision and regulation by the appropriate government authorities in the foreign board of trade's home country.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Linked contracts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Commission may not permit a foreign board of trade to provide to the members of the foreign board of trade or other participants located in the United States direct access to the electronic trading and order-matching system of the foreign board of trade with respect to an agreement, contract, or transaction that settles against any price (including the daily or final settlement price) of 1 or more contracts listed for trading on a registered entity, unless the Commission determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the foreign board of trade makes public daily trading information regarding the agreement, contract, or transaction that is comparable to the daily trading information published by the registered entity for the 1 or more contracts against which the agreement, contract, or transaction traded on the foreign board of trade settles; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the foreign board of trade (or the foreign futures authority that oversees the foreign board of trade)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) adopts position limits (including related hedge exemption provisions) for the agreement, contract, or transaction that are comparable to the position lim<!-- PDFPage:45 -->its (including related hedge exemption provisions) adopted by the registered entity for the 1 or more contracts against which the agreement, contract, or transaction traded on the foreign board of trade settles;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) has the authority to require or direct market participants to limit, reduce, or liquidate any position the foreign board of trade (or the foreign futures authority that oversees the foreign board of trade) determines to be necessary to prevent or reduce the threat of price manipulation, excessive speculation as described in section 6a of this title, price distortion, or disruption of delivery or the cash settlement process;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) agrees to promptly notify the Commission, with regard to the agreement, contract, or transaction that settles against any price (including the daily or final settlement price) of 1 or more contracts listed for trading on a registered entity, of any change regarding&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-5em">(aa) the information that the foreign board of trade will make publicly available;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-5em">(bb) the position limits that the foreign board of trade or foreign futures authority will adopt and enforce;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-5em">(cc) the position reductions required to prevent manipulation, excessive speculation as described in section 6a of this title, price distortion, or disruption of delivery or the cash settlement process; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-5em">(dd) any other area of interest expressed by the Commission to the foreign board of trade or foreign futures authority;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(IV) provides information to the Commission regarding large trader positions in the agreement, contract, or transaction that is comparable to the large trader position information collected by the Commission for the 1 or more contracts against which the agreement, contract, or transaction traded on the foreign board of trade settles; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(V) provides the Commission such information as is necessary to publish reports on aggregate trader positions for the agreement, contract, or transaction traded on the foreign board of trade that are comparable to such reports on aggregate trader positions for the 1 or more contracts against which the agreement, contract, or transaction traded on the foreign board of trade settles.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Existing foreign boards of trade</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subparagraphs (A) and (B) shall not be effective with respect to any foreign board of trade to which, prior to July 21, 2010, the Commission granted direct access permission until the date that is 180 days after July 21, 2010.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Persons located in the United States</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Commission may adopt rules and regulations proscribing fraud and requiring minimum financial standards, the disclosure of risk, the filing of reports, the keeping of books and records, the safeguarding of customers&apos; funds, and registration with the Commission by any person located in the United States, its territories or possessions, who engages in the offer or sale of any contract of sale of a commodity for future delivery that is made or to be made on or subject to the rules of a board of trade, exchange, or market located outside the United States, its territories or possessions.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Different requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Rules and regulations described in subparagraph (A) may impose different requirements for such persons depending upon the particular foreign board of trade, exchange, or market involved.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Prohibition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in paragraphs (1) and (2), no rule or regulation may be adopted by the Commission under this subsection that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) requires Commission approval of any contract, rule, regulation, or action of any foreign board of trade, exchange, or market, or clearinghouse for such board of trade, exchange, or market; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) governs in any way any rule or contract term or action of any foreign board of trade, exchange, or market, or clearinghouse for such board of trade, exchange, or market.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Public interest exemptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In order to promote responsible economic or financial innovation and fair competition, the Commission by rule, regulation, or order, after notice and opportunity for hearing, may (on its own initiative or on application of any person, including any board of trade designated or registered as a contract market or derivatives transaction execution facility for transactions for future delivery in any commodity under section 7 of this title) exempt any agreement, contract, or transaction (or class thereof) that is otherwise subject to subsection (a) (including any person or class of persons offering, entering into, rendering advice or rendering other services with respect to, the agreement, contract, or transaction), either unconditionally or on stated terms or conditions or for stated periods and either retroactively or prospectively, or both, from any of the requirements of subsection (a), or from any other provision of this chapter (except subparagraphs (C)(ii) and (D) of section 2(a)(1) of this title,&#160;<sup><a href="#6_2_target" name="6_2">2</a></sup> except that&mdash;</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;6a. Excessive speculation</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Burden on interstate commerce; trading or position limits</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Excessive speculation in any commodity under contracts of sale of such commodity for future delivery made on or subject to the rules of contract markets or derivatives transaction execution facilities, or swaps that perform or affect a significant price discovery function with respect to registered entities causing sudden or unreasonable fluctuations or unwarranted changes in the price of such commodity, is an undue and unnecessary burden on interstate commerce in such commodity. For the purpose of diminishing, eliminating, or preventing such burden, the Commission shall, from time to time, after due notice and opportunity for hearing, by rule, regulation, or order, proclaim and fix such limits on the amounts of trading which may be done or positions which may be held by any person, including any group or class of traders, under contracts of sale of such commodity for future delivery on or subject to the rules of any contract market or derivatives transaction execution facility, or swaps traded on or subject to the rules of a designated contract market or a swap execution facility, or swaps not traded on or subject to the rules of a designated contract market or a swap execution facility that performs a significant price discovery function with respect to a registered entity, as the Commission finds are necessary to diminish, eliminate, or prevent such burden. In determining whether any person has exceeded such limits, the positions held and trading done by any persons directly or indirectly controlled by such person shall be included with the positions held and trading done by such person; and further, such limits upon positions and trading shall apply to positions held by, and trading done by, two or more persons acting pursuant to an expressed or implied agreement or understanding, the same as if the positions were held by, or the trading were done by, a single person. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the Commission from fixing different trading or position limits for different commodities, markets, futures, or delivery months, or for different number of days remaining until the last day of trading in a contract, or different trading limits for buying and selling operations, or different limits for the purposes of paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (b) of this section, or from exempting transactions normally known to the trade as &quot;spreads&quot; or &quot;straddles&quot; or &quot;arbitrage&quot; or from fixing limits applying to such transactions or positions different from limits fixed for other transactions or positions. The word &quot;arbitrage&quot; in domestic markets shall be defined to mean the same as &quot;spread&quot; or &quot;straddle&quot;. The Commission is authorized to define the term &quot;international arbitrage&quot;.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Establishment of limitations</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In accordance with the standards set forth in paragraph (1) of this subsection and consistent with the good faith exception cited in subsection (b)(2), with respect to physical commodities other than excluded commodities as defined by the Commission, the Commission shall by rule, regulation, or order establish limits on the amount of positions, as appropriate, other than bona fide hedge positions, that may be held by any person <!-- PDFPage:49 -->with respect to contracts of sale for future delivery or with respect to options on the contracts or commodities traded on or subject to the rules of a designated contract market.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Timing</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Exempt commodities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For exempt commodities, the limits required under subparagraph (A) shall be established within 180 days after July 21, 2010.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Agricultural commodities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For agricultural commodities, the limits required under subparagraph (A) shall be established within 270 days after July 21, 2010.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Goal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In establishing the limits required under subparagraph (A), the Commission shall strive to ensure that trading on foreign boards of trade in the same commodity will be subject to comparable limits and that any limits to be imposed by the Commission will not cause price discovery in the commodity to shift to trading on the foreign boards of trade.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Specific limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In establishing the limits required in paragraph (2), the Commission, as appropriate, shall set limits&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) on the number of positions that may be held by any person for the spot month, each other month, and the aggregate number of positions that may be held by any person for all months; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to the maximum extent practicable, in its discretion&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) to diminish, eliminate, or prevent excessive speculation as described under this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) to deter and prevent market manipulation, squeezes, and corners;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) to ensure sufficient market liquidity for bona fide hedgers; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) to ensure that the price discovery function of the underlying market is not disrupted.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Significant price discovery function</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In making a determination whether a swap performs or affects a significant price discovery function with respect to regulated markets, the Commission shall consider, as appropriate:</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Price linkage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The extent to which the swap uses or otherwise relies on a daily or final settlement price, or other major price parameter, of another contract traded on a regulated market based upon the same underlying commodity, to value a position, transfer or convert a position, financially settle a position, or close out a position.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Arbitrage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The extent to which the price for the swap is sufficiently related to the price of another contract traded on a regulated market based upon the same underlying commodity so as to permit market participants to effectively arbitrage between the markets by simultaneously maintaining positions or executing trades in the swaps on a frequent and recurring basis.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Material price reference</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The extent to which, on a frequent and recurring basis, bids, offers, or transactions in a contract traded on a regulated market are directly based on, or are determined by referencing, the price generated by the swap.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Material liquidity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The extent to which the volume of swaps being traded in the commodity is sufficient to have a material effect on another contract traded on a regulated market.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Other material factors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Such other material factors as the Commission specifies by rule or regulation as relevant to determine whether a swap serves a significant price discovery function with respect to a regulated market.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Economically equivalent contracts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the Commission shall establish limits on the amount of positions, including aggregate position limits, as appropriate, other than bona fide hedge positions, that may be held by any person with respect to swaps that are economically equivalent to contracts of sale for future delivery or to options on the contracts or commodities traded on or subject to the rules of a designated contract market subject to paragraph (2).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) In establishing limits pursuant to subparagraph (A), the Commission shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) develop the limits concurrently with limits established under paragraph (2), and the limits shall have similar requirements as under paragraph (3)(B); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) establish the limits simultaneously with limits established under paragraph (2).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Aggregate position limits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission shall, by rule or regulation, establish limits (including related hedge exemption provisions) on the aggregate number or amount of positions in contracts based upon the same underlying commodity (as defined by the Commission) that may be held by any person, including any group or class of traders, for each month across&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) contracts listed by designated contract markets;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) with respect to an agreement contract, or transaction that settles against any price (including the daily or final settlement price) of 1 or more contracts listed for trading on a registered entity, contracts traded on a foreign board of trade that provides members or other participants located in the United States with direct access to its electronic trading and order matching system; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) swap contracts that perform or affect a significant price discovery function with respect to regulated entities.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:50 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Exemptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission, by rule, regulation, or order, may exempt, conditionally or unconditionally, any person or class of persons, any swap or class of swaps, any contract of sale of a commodity for future delivery or class of such contracts, any option or class of options, or any transaction or class of transactions from any requirement it may establish under this section with respect to position limits.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Prohibition on trading or positions in excess of limits fixed by Commission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall, in such rule, regulation, or order, fix a reasonable time (not to exceed ten days) after the promulgation of the rule, regulation, or order; after which, and until such rule, regulation, or order is suspended, modified, or revoked, it shall be unlawful for any person&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) directly or indirectly to buy or sell, or agree to buy or sell, under contracts of sale of such commodity for future delivery on or subject to the rules of the contract market or markets, or swap execution facility or facilities with respect to a significant price discovery contract, to which the rule, regulation, or order applies, any amount of such commodity during any one business day in excess of any trading limit fixed for one business day by the Commission in such rule, regulation, or order for or with respect to such commodity; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) directly or indirectly to hold or control a net long or a net short position in any commodity for future delivery on or subject to the rules of any contract market or swap execution facility with respect to a significant price discovery contract in excess of any position limit fixed by the Commission for or with respect to such commodity: <i>Provided</i>, That such position limit shall not apply to a position acquired in good faith prior to the effective date of such rule, regulation, or order.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Applicability to bona fide hedging transactions or positions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) No rule, regulation, or order issued under subsection (a) of this section shall apply to transactions or positions which are shown to be bona fide hedging transactions or positions as such terms shall be defined by the Commission by rule, regulation, or order consistent with the purposes of this chapter. Such terms may be defined to permit producers, purchasers, sellers, middlemen, and users of a commodity or a product derived therefrom to hedge their legitimate anticipated business needs for that period of time into the future for which an appropriate futures contract is open and available on an exchange. To determine the adequacy of this chapter and the powers of the Commission acting thereunder to prevent unwarranted price pressures by large hedgers, the Commission shall monitor and analyze the trading activities of the largest hedgers, as determined by the Commission, operating in the cattle, hog, or pork belly markets and shall report its findings and recommendations to the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry and the House Committee on Agriculture in its annual reports for at least two years following January 11, 1983.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For the purposes of implementation of subsection (a)(2) for contracts of sale for future delivery or options on the contracts or commodities, the Commission shall define what constitutes a bona fide hedging transaction or position as a transaction or position that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A)(i) represents a substitute for transactions made or to be made or positions taken or to be taken at a later time in a physical marketing channel;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) is economically appropriate to the reduction of risks in the conduct and management of a commercial enterprise; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) arises from the potential change in the value of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) assets that a person owns, produces, manufactures, processes, or merchandises or anticipates owning, producing, manufacturing, processing, or merchandising;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) liabilities that a person owns or anticipates incurring; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(III) services that a person provides, purchases, or anticipates providing or purchasing; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) reduces risks attendant to a position resulting from a swap that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) was executed opposite a counterparty for which the transaction would qualify as a bona fide hedging transaction pursuant to subparagraph (A); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) meets the requirements of subparagraph (A).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Persons subject to regulation; applicability to transactions made by or on behalf of United States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This section shall apply to a person that is registered as a futures commission merchant, an introducing broker, or a floor broker under authority of this chapter only to the extent that transactions made by such person are made on behalf of or for the account or benefit of such person.

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Any person desiring to be designated or registered as a contract market or derivatives transaction execution facility shall make application to the Commission for the designation or registration and accompany the same with a showing that it complies with the conditions set forth in this chapter, and with a sufficient assurance that it will continue to comply with the the&#160;<sup><a href="#8_1_target" name="8_1">1</a></sup> requirements of this chapter. The Commission shall approve or deny an application for designation or registration as a contract market or derivatives transaction execution facility within 180 days of the filing of the application. If the Commission notifies the person that its application is materially incomplete and specifies the deficiencies in the application, the running of the 180-day period shall be stayed from the time of such notification until the application is resubmitted in completed form: <i>Provided</i>, That the Commission shall have not less than sixty days to approve or deny the application from the time the application is resubmitted in completed form. If the Commission denies an application, it shall specify the grounds for the denial. In the event of a refusal to designate or register as a contract market or derivatives transaction execution facility any person that has made application therefor, the person shall be afforded an opportunity for a hearing on the record before the Commission, with the right to appeal an adverse decision after such hearing to the court of appeals as provided for in other cases in subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Commission is authorized to suspend for a period not to exceed 6 months or to revoke the designation or registration of any contract market or derivatives transaction execution facility on a showing that the contract market or derivatives transaction execution facility is not enforcing or has not enforced its rules of government, made a condition of its designation or registration as set forth in sections 7 through 7a&ndash;1 of this title or section 7b&ndash;1 of this title, or that the contract market or derivatives transaction execution facility or electronic trading facility, or any director, officer, agent, or employee thereof, otherwise is violating or has violated any of the provisions of this chapter or any of the rules, regulations, or orders of the Commission thereunder. Such suspension or revocation shall only be made after a notice to the officers of the contract market or derivatives transaction execution facility or electronic trading facility affected and upon a hearing on the record: <i>Provided</i>, That such suspension or revocation shall be final and conclusive, unless within fifteen days after such suspension or revocation by the Commission such person appeals to the court of appeals for the circuit in which it has its principal place of business, by filing with the clerk of such court a written petition praying that the order of the Commission be set aside or modified in the manner stated in the petition, together with a bond in such sum as the court may determine, conditioned that such person will pay the costs of the proceedings if the court so directs. The clerk of the court in which such a petition is filed shall immediately cause a copy thereof to be delivered to the Commission and file in the court the record in such proceedings, as provided in section 2112 of title 28. The testimony and evidence taken or submitted before the Commission, duly filed as aforesaid as a part of the record, shall be considered by the court of appeals as the evidence in the case. Such a court may affirm or set aside the order of the Commission or may direct it to modify its order. No such order of the Commission shall be modified or set aside by the court of appeals unless it is shown by the person that the order is unsupported by the weight of the evidence or was issued without due notice and a reasonable opportunity having been afforded to such person for a hearing, or infringes the Constitution of the United States, or is beyond the jurisdiction of the Commission.</p>

The Commission may publish from time to time the results of any such investigation and such general statistical information gathered therefrom as it deems of interest to the public: <i>Provided</i>, That except as otherwise specifically authorized in this chapter, the Commission may not publish data and information that would separately disclose the business transactions or market positions of any person and trade secrets or names of customers: <i>Provided further</i>, That the Commission may withhold from public disclosure any data or information concerning or obtained in connection with any pending investigation of any person. The Commission shall not be compelled to disclose any information or data obtained from a foreign futures authority if&mdash;</p>

Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to authorize the Commission to withhold information or data from Congress. For purposes of section 552 of title 5, this subsection shall be considered a statute described in subsection (b)(3)(B) of section 552.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In conducting investigations authorized under this subsection or any other provision of this chapter, the Commission shall continue, as the Commission determines necessary, to request the assistance of and cooperate with the appropriate Federal agencies in the conduct of such investigations, including undercover operations by such agencies. The Commission and the Department of Justice shall assess the effectiveness of such undercover operations and, within two years of October 28, 1992, shall recommend to Congress any additional undercover or other authority for the Commission that the Commission or the Department of Justice believes to be necessary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Commission shall provide the Securities and Exchange Commission with notice of the commencement of any proceeding and a copy of any order entered by the Commission against any futures commission merchant or introducing broker registered pursuant to section 6f(a)(2) of this title, any floor broker or floor trader exempt from registration pursuant to section 6f(a)(3) of this title, any associated person exempt from registration pursuant to section 6k(6) of this title, or any board of trade designated as a contract market pursuant to section 7b&ndash;1 of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">If any registered entity is not enforcing or has not enforced its rules of government made a condition of its designation or registration as set forth in sections 7 through 7a&ndash;2 of this title, or if any registered entity, or any director, officer, agent, or employee of any registered entity otherwise is violating or has violated any of the provisions of this chapter or any of the rules, regulations, or orders of the Commission thereunder, the Commission may, upon notice and hearing on the record and subject to appeal as in other cases provided for in section 8(b) of this title, make and enter an order directing that such registered entity, director, officer, agent, or employee shall cease and desist from such violation, and assess a civil penalty of not more than $500,000 for each such violation, or, in any case of manipulation or attempted manipulation in violation of section 9, 15, 13b, or 13(a)(2) of this title, a civil penalty of not more than $1,000,000 for each such violation. If such registered entity, director, officer, agent, or employee, after the entry of such a cease and desist order and the lapse of the period allowed for appeal of such order or after the affirmance of such order, shall fail or refuse to obey or comply with such order, such registered entity, director, officer, agent, or employee shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined not more than $500,000 or imprisoned for not less than six months nor more than one year, or both, except that if the failure or refusal to obey or comply with the order involved any offense under section 13(a)(2) of this title, the registered entity, director, officer, agent, or employee shall be guilty of a felony and, on conviction, shall be subject to penalties under section 13(a)(2) of this title. Each day during which such failure or refusal to obey such cease and desist order continues shall be deemed a separate offense. If the offending registered entity or other person upon whom such penalty is imposed, after the lapse of the period allowed for appeal or after the affirmance of such penalty, shall fail to pay such penalty, the Commission shall refer the matter to the Attorney General who shall recover such penalty by action in the appropriate United States district court. In determining the amount of the money penalty assessed under this section, the Commission shall consider the gravity of the offense, and in the case of a registered entity shall further consider whether the amount of the penalty will materially impair the ability of the registered entity to carry on its operations and duties.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;18. Complaints against registered persons</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Petition for actual damages</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any person complaining of any violation of any provision of this chapter, or any rule, regulation, or order issued pursuant to this chapter, by any person who is registered under this chapter may, at any time within two years after the cause of action accrues, apply to the Commission for an order awarding&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) actual damages proximately caused by such violation. If an award of actual damages is made against a floor broker in connection with the execution of a customer order, and the futures commission merchant which selected the floor broker for the execution of the customer order is held to be responsible under section 2(a)(1) of this title for the floor broker's violation, such futures commission merchant may be required to satisfy such award; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in the case of any action arising from a willful and intentional violation in the execu<!-- PDFPage:133 -->tion of an order on the floor of a registered entity, punitive or exemplary damages equal to no more than two times the amount of such actual damages. If an award of punitive or exemplary damages is made against a floor broker in connection with the execution of a customer order, and the futures commission merchant which selected the floor broker for the execution of the customer order is held to be responsible under section 2(a)(1) of this title for the floor broker's violation, such futures commission merchant may be required to satisfy such award if the floor broker fails to do so, except that such requirement shall apply to the futures commission merchant only if it willfully and intentionally selected the floor broker with the intent to assist or facilitate the floor broker's violation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) An action may be brought under this subsection by any one or more persons described in this subsection for and in behalf of such person or persons and other persons similarly situated, if the Commission permits such actions pursuant to a final rule issued by the Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Not later than two hundred and seventy days after October 28, 1992, the Commission shall propose and publish for public comment such rules as are necessary to carry out subparagraph (A). In developing such rules, the Commission shall consider the potential impact of such actions on resources available to the reparations system established under this chapter and the relative merits of bringing such actions in Federal court.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Rules and regulations; control over right of appeal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission may promulgate such rules, regulations, and orders as it deems necessary or appropriate for the efficient and expeditious administration of this section. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, such rules, regulations, and orders may prescribe, or otherwise condition, without limitation, the form, filing, and service of pleadings or orders, the nature and scope of discovery, counterclaims, motion practice (including the grounds for dismissal of any claim or counterclaim), hearings (including the waiver thereof, which may relate to the amount in controversy), rights of appeal, if any, and all other matters governing proceedings before the Commission under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Bond requirement when complainant is nonresident; waiver</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In case a complaint is made by a nonresident of the United States, the complainant shall be required, before any formal action is taken on his complaint, to furnish a bond in double the amount of the claim conditioned upon the payment of costs, including a reasonable attorney's fee for the respondent if the respondent shall prevail, and any reparation award that may be issued by the Commission against the complainant on any counterclaim by respondent: <i>Provided</i>, That the Commission shall have authority to waive the furnishing of a bond by a complainant who is a resident of a country which permits the filing of a complaint by a resident of the United States without the furnishing of a bond.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Enforcement of reparation award</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If any person against whom an award has been made does not pay the reparation award within the time specified in the Commission's order, the complainant, or any person for whose benefit such order was made, within three years of the date of the order, may file a certified copy of the order of the Commission, in the district court of the United States for the district in which he resides or in which is located the principal place of business of the respondent, for enforcement of such reparation award by appropriate orders. The orders, writs, and processes of such district court may in such case run, be served, and be returnable anywhere in the United States. The petitioner shall not be liable for costs in the district court, nor for costs at any subsequent state of the proceedings, unless they accrue upon his appeal. If the petitioner finally prevails, he shall be allowed a reasonable attorney's fee, to be taxed and collected as a part of the costs of the suit. Subject to the right of appeal under subsection (e) of this section, an order of the Commission awarding reparations shall be final and conclusive.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A reparation award shall be directly enforceable in district court as if it were a judgment pursuant to section 1963 of title 28. This paragraph shall operate retroactively from the effective date of its enactment, and shall apply to all reparation awards for which a proceeding described in paragraph (1) is commenced within 3 years of the date of the Commission's order.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any order of the Commission entered hereunder shall be reviewable on petition of any party aggrieved thereby, by the United States Court of Appeals for any circuit in which a hearing was held, or if no hearing was held, any circuit in which the appellee is located, under the procedure provided in section 9 of this title. Such appeal shall not be effective unless within 30 days from and after the date of the reparation order the appellant also files with the clerk of the court a bond in double the amount of the reparation awarded against the appellant conditioned upon the payment of the judgment entered by the court, plus interest and costs, including a reasonable attorney's fee for the appellee, if the appellee shall prevail. Such bond shall be in the form of cash, negotiable securities having a market value at least equivalent to the amount of bond prescribed, or the undertaking of a surety company on the approved list of sureties issued by the Treasury Department of the United States. The appellee shall not be liable for costs in said court. If the appellee prevails, he shall be allowed a reasonable attorney's fee to be taxed and collected as a part of his costs.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Automatic bar from trading and suspension for noncompliance; effect of appeal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Unless the party against whom a reparation order has been issued shows to the satisfaction of the Commission within fifteen days from the expiration of the period allowed for compliance with such order that either an appeal as herein authorized has been taken or payment of the full amount of the order (or any agreed settle<!-- PDFPage:134 -->ment thereof) has been made, such party shall be prohibited automatically from trading on all registered entities and, if the party is registered with the Commission, such registration shall be suspended automatically at the expiration of such fifteen-day period until such party shows to the satisfaction of the Commission that payment of such amount with interest thereon to date of payment has been made: <i>Provided</i>, That if on appeal the appellee prevails or if the appeal is dismissed, the automatic prohibition against trading and suspension of registration shall become effective at the expiration of thirty days from the date of judgment on the appeal, but if the judgment is stayed by a court of competent jurisdiction, the suspension shall become effective ten days after the expiration of such stay, unless prior thereto the judgment of the court has been satisfied.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Predispute resolution agreements for institutional customers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section prohibits a registered futures commission merchant from requiring a customer that is an eligible contract participant, as a condition to the commission merchant's conducting a transaction for the customer, to enter into an agreement waiving the right to file a claim under this section.</p>
