At any time prior to the close of the hearing the Secretary of Agriculture may amend the complaint; but in case of any amendment adding new provisions the hearing shall, on the request of the person, be adjourned for a period not exceeding fifteen days.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Report of Secretary of Agriculture</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If, after such hearing, the Secretary of Agriculture finds that the person has violated or is violating any provisions of the chapter or rules and regulations covered by the charges, he shall make a report in writing in which he shall state his findings as to the facts, and shall issue and cause to be served on the person an order requiring such person to cease and desist from continuing such violation. The testimony taken at the hearing shall be reduced to writing and filed in the records of the Department of Agriculture.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Amendment of report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Until the record in such hearing has been filed in a court of appeals as provided in section 1600 of this title, the Secretary of Agriculture at any time, upon such notice and in such manner as he deems proper, but only after reasonable opportunity to the person to be heard, may amend or set aside the report or order, in whole or in part.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The clerk of the court shall immediately cause a copy of the petition to be delivered to the Secretary, and the Secretary shall thereupon file in the court the record in such proceedings, as provided in section 2112 of title 28.

<p class="statutory-body">The evidence so taken or admitted and filed as aforesaid as a part of the record, shall be considered by the court as the evidence in the case.</p>

The Secretary may modify his findings as to the facts, or make new findings, by reason of the additional evidence so taken, and he shall file such modified or new findings and his recommendations, if any, for the modification or setting aside of his order, with the return of such additional evidence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">If the court of appeals affirms or modifies the order of the Secretary, its decree shall operate as an injunction to restrain the person and his officers, directors, agents, and employees from violating the provisions of such order or such order as modified.</p>
