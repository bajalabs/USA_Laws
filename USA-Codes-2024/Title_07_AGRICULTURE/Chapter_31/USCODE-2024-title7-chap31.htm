Such appointments are now subject to the civil service laws unless specifically excepted by those laws or by laws enacted subsequent to Executive Order 8743, Apr. 23, 1941, issued by the President pursuant to act Nov. 26, 1940, ch. 919, title I, &sect;1, 54 Stat. 1211, which covered most excepted positions into the classified (competitive) civil service. The Order is set out as a note under section 3301 of Title 5, Government Organization and Employees. As to the compensation of such personnel, sections 1202 and 1204 of the Classification Act of 1949, 63 Stat. 972, 973, repealed the Classification Act of 1923 and all other laws or parts of laws inconsistent with the 1949 Act.

<p class="statutory-body">From such sums as are from time to time made available by the Congress to the Secretary for such purpose, pursuant to section 903 of this title, the Secretary is authorized and empowered to make loans to persons now providing or who may hereafter provide telephone service in rural areas, to public bodies now providing telephone service in rural areas and to cooperative, nonprofit, limited dividend, or mutual associations. Except as otherwise provided by this subchapter, such loans shall be made under the same terms and conditions as are provided in section 904 of this title, for the purpose of financing the improvement, expansion, construction, acquisition, and operation of telephone lines, facilities, or systems to furnish and improve telephone service in rural areas: <i>Provided, however</i>, That the Secretary, in making such loans, shall give preference to persons providing telephone service in rural areas, to public bodies now providing telephone service in rural areas, and to cooperative, nonprofit, limited dividend, or mutual associations. The Secretary in making such loans shall, insofar as possible, obtain assurance that the telephone service to be furnished or improved thereby will be made available to the widest practical number of rural users. When it is determined by the Secretary to be necessary in order to furnish or improve telephone service in rural areas, such loans may be made for the improvement, expansion, construction, acquisition, and operation of telephone lines, facilities, or systems without regard to their geographical location. The Secretary is further authorized and empowered to make loans for the purpose of refinancing outstanding indebtedness of persons furnishing telephone service in rural areas, including indebtedness of recipients on another telecommunications loan made under this chapter. Loans under this section shall not be made unless the Secretary finds and certifies that in his judgment the security therefor is reasonably adequate and such loan will be repaid within the time agreed and that no duplication of lines, facilities, or systems, providing reasonably adequate services will result therefrom.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Secretary is authorized to make and issue interim notes to the Secretary of the Treasury for the purpose of obtaining funds necessary for discharging obligations of the fund and for making loans, advances and authorized expenditures out of the fund. Such notes shall be in such form and denominations and have such maturities and be subject to such terms and conditions as may be agreed upon by the Secretary and the Secretary of the Treasury. Such notes shall bear interest at a rate fixed by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration the current average market yield of outstanding marketable obligations of the United States having maturities comparable to the notes issued by the Secretary under this section. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to purchase any notes of the Secretary issued hereunder, and, for that purpose, the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to use as a public debt transaction the proceeds from the sale of any securities issued under chapter 31 of title 31, and the purposes for which such securities may be issued under such chapter are extended to include the purchase of notes issued by the Secretary. All redemptions, purchases, and sales by the Secretary of the Treasury of such notes shall be treated as public debt transactions of the United States: <i>Provided, however</i>, That such interim notes to the Secretary of the Treasury shall not be included in the totals of the budget of the United States Government and shall be exempt from any general limitation imposed by statute on expenditures and net lending (budget outlays) of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to purchase for resale obligations insured through the fund when offered by the Secretary. Such resales shall be upon such terms and conditions as the Secretary of the Treasury shall determine. Purchases and resales by the Secretary of the Treasury hereunder shall not be included in the totals of the budget of the United States Government and shall be exempt from any general limitation imposed by statute on expenditures and not lending (budget outlays) of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Secretary may, on an insured basis or otherwise, sell and assign any notes in the fund or sell certificates of beneficial ownership therein to the Secretary of the Treasury or in the private market. Any sale by the Secretary of notes individually or in blocks shall be treated as a sale of assets for the purposes of chapter 11 of title 31, notwithstanding the fact that the Secretary, under an agreement with the purchaser or purchasers, holds the debt instruments evidencing the loans and holds or reinvests payments thereon as trustee and custodian for the purchaser or purchasers of the individual note or of the certificate of beneficial ownership in a number of such notes. Security instruments taken by the Secretary in connection with any notes in the fund may constitute liens running to the United States notwithstanding the fact that such notes may be thereafter held by purchasers thereof.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Conditions for prepayment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in subsection (c), a borrower of a loan made by the Federal Financing Bank and guaranteed under section 936 of this title may prepay such loan (or any loan advance thereunder) by paying the outstanding principal balance due on the loan (or advance), if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the loan is outstanding on July 2, 1986;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) private capital, with the existing loan guarantee, is used to replace the loan; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the borrower certifies that any savings from such prepayment will be passed on to its customers or used to improve the financial strength of the borrower in cases of financial hardship.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Charges on prepayment prohibited</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No sums in addition to the payment of the outstanding principal balance due on the loan may be charged as the result of such prepayment against the borrower, the fund, or the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Disqualification for prepayment on finding of adverse affect on Federal Financing Bank</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A borrower will not qualify for prepayment under this section if, in the opinion of the Secretary of the Treasury, to prepay in such borrower's case would adversely affect the operation of the Federal Financing Bank.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Paragraph (1) shall be effective in fiscal year 1987 only for any loan the prepayment of the principal amount of which will cause the cumulative amount of net proceeds from all such prepayments made during such year to exceed $2,017,500,000.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Amount of permissible prepayments; establishment of eligibility criteria</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall permit, subject to subsection (a), prepayments of principal on loans in fiscal year 1987 under this section or Public Law 99&ndash;349 in such amounts as to realize net proceeds from all such prepayments in fiscal year 1987 in an amount not less than $2,017,500,000.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall establish&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) eligibility criteria to ensure that any loan prepayment activity required to be carried out under this subsection will be directed to those cooperative borrowers in greatest need of the benefits associated with prepayment, as determined by the Secretary; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) such other eligibility criteria as the Secretary determines are necessary to carry out this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Assignability and transferability of guarantees of loans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any guarantee of a loan prepaid under this section shall be fully assignable under the provisions of section 936 of this title and transferable. However, the Secretary may require that any such guarantee, if transfered&#160;<sup><a href="#936a_1_target" name="936a_1">1</a></sup> or assigned, be transferred or assigned to a loan or security that, if sold, will be grouped with nonguaranteed loans or securities and sold in a manner to ensure that such sale will not unreasonably compete with the marketing of obligations of the United States.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Tax exempt financing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a borrower prepays a loan under this subsection using tax exempt financing, the discount shall be adjusted to ensure that the bor<!-- PDFPage:541 -->rower receives a benefit that is equal to the benefit the borrower would receive if the borrower used fully taxable financing.

If a borrower prepays using tax exempt financing, the discount shall be adjusted to make the discount equivalent to fully taxable financing. The borrower shall certify in writing whether the financing will be tax exempt and shall comply with such other terms and conditions as the Secretary may establish which are reasonable and necessary to implement this provision.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of this section is to encourage the expansion and extension of middle mile broadband infrastructure to connect underserved rural areas to the backbone of the Internet.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Middle mile infrastructure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purposes of this section, the term &quot;middle mile infrastructure&quot; means any broadband infrastructure that does not connect directly to end-user locations (including anchor institutions) and may include interoffice transport, backhaul, Internet connectivity, data centers, or special access transport to rural areas.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Grants, loans, and loan guarantees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall make grants, loans, and loan guarantees to eligible applicants described in subsection (d) to provide funds for the construction, improvement, or acquisition of middle mile infrastructure to serve rural areas.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Eligibility</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Eligible applicants</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">To be eligible to obtain assistance under this section, an eligible entity shall&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Eligible service territories</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The proceeds of assistance provided under this section may be used to carry out a project in a proposed service territory only if, as of the date the application for assistance under this section is submitted, there is not adequate middle mile infrastructure available to support broadband service for eligible rural communities that would be provided access to the middle mile infrastructure.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:560 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Eligible projects</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A project shall be eligible for assistance under this section if at the time of the application&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) at least 75 percent of the interconnection points serve such eligible rural areas; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the Secretary determines that the proposed middle mile network will be capable of supporting retail broadband service meeting the maximum broadband buildout requirement established under section 950bb(e)(4) of this title for the residents within the proposed service territory.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Limitation on grants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In making grants under this section, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) not provide any grant in excess of 20 percent of the total project cost; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) provide grants only to those projects which serve rural areas where population density or geographic characteristics make it infeasible to construct middle mile broadband systems without grant assistance.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Terms, conditions, and adequacy of security</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">All loans and loan guarantees provided under this section shall be made subject to such terms, conditions, and adequacy of security requirements as may be imposed by the Secretary. If the middle mile infrastructure would not provide adequate security due to long-term leasing arrangements, the Secretary shall require substitute security in such form and substance as are acceptable to the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Authorization of appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There is authorized to be appropriated to carry out this section $10,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2018 through 2023.</p>
