<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1621. Congressional declaration of purpose; use of existing facilities; cooperation with States</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress declares that a sound, efficient, and privately operated system for distributing and marketing agricultural products is essential to a prosperous agriculture and is indispensable to the maintenance of full employment and to the welfare, prosperity, and health of the Nation. It is further declared to be the policy of Congress to promote through research, study, experimentation, and through cooperation among Federal and State agencies, farm organizations, and private industry a scientific approach to the problems of marketing, transportation, and distribution of agricultural products similar to the scientific methods which have been utilized so successfully during the past eighty-four years in connection with the production of agricultural products so that such products capable of being produced in abundance may be marketed in an orderly manner and efficiently distributed. In order to attain these objectives, it is the intent of Congress to provide for (1) continuous research to improve the marketing, handling, storage, processing, transportation, and distribution of agricultural products; (2) cooperation among Federal and State agencies, producers, industry organizations, and others in the development and effectuation of research and marketing programs to improve the distribution processes; (3) an integrated administration of all laws enacted by Congress to aid the distribution of agricultural products through research, market aids and services, and regulatory activities, to the end that marketing methods and facilities may be improved, that distribution costs may be reduced and the price spread between the producer and consumer may be narrowed, that dietary and nutritional standards may be improved, that new and wider markets for American agricultural products may be developed, both in the United States and in other countries, with a view to making it possible for the full production of American farms to be disposed of usefully, economically, profitably, and in an orderly manner. In effectuating the purposes of this chapter, maximum use shall be made of existing research facilities owned or controlled by the Federal Government or by State agricultural experiment stations and of the facilities of the Federal and State extension services. To the maximum extent practicable marketing research work done under this chapter in cooperation with the States shall be done in cooperation with the State agricultural experiment stations; marketing educational and <!-- PDFPage:896 -->demonstrational work done under this chapter in cooperation with the States shall be done in cooperation with the State agricultural extension service; market information, inspection, regulatory work and other marketing service done under this chapter in cooperation with the State agencies shall be done in cooperation with the State departments of agriculture, and State bureaus and departments of markets.</p>

<h4 class="note-sub-head">&quot;SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(1) A secure domestic food supply is a national security imperative for the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(2) A competitive specialty crop industry in the United States is necessary for the production of an abundant, affordable supply of highly nutritious fruits, vegetables, and other specialty crops, which are vital to the health and well-being of all Americans.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(3) Increased consumption of specialty crops will provide tremendous health and economic benefits to both consumers and specialty crop growers.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(4) Specialty crop growers believe that there are numerous areas of Federal agriculture policy that could be improved to promote increased consumption of specialty crops and increase the competitiveness of producers in the efficient production of affordable specialty crops in the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(5) As the globalization of markets continues, it is becoming increasingly difficult for United States producers to compete against heavily subsidized foreign producers in both the domestic and foreign markets.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(6) United States specialty crop producers also continue to face serious tariff and non-tariff trade barriers in many export markets.</p>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(b) <cap-smallcap>Purpose</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the purpose of this Act [see Short Title of 2004 Amendment note set out under section 3101 of this title] to make necessary changes in Federal agriculture policy to accomplish the goals of increasing fruit, vegetable, and nut consumption and improving the competitiveness of United States specialty crop producers.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&quot;SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&quot;In this Act:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(1) The term &apos;specialty crop&apos; means fruits and vegetables, tree nuts, dried fruits, and horticulture and nursery crops (including floriculture).</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(2) The term &apos;State&apos; means the several States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the United States Virgin Islands, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(3) The term &apos;State department of agriculture&apos; means the agency, commission, or department of a State government responsible for agriculture within the State.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) In carrying out the provisions of this chapter, the Secretary of Agriculture may cooperate with other branches of the Government, State agencies, private research organizations, purchasing and consuming organizations, boards of trade, chambers of commerce, other associations of business or trade organizations, transportation and storage agencies and organizations, or other persons or corporations engaged in the production, transportation, storing, processing, marketing, and distribution of agricultural products whether operating in one or more jurisdictions. The Secretary of Agriculture shall have authority to enter into contracts and agreements under the terms of regulations promulgated by him with States and agencies of States, private firms, institutions, and individuals for the purpose of conducting research and service work, making and compiling reports and surveys, and carrying out other functions relating thereto when in his judgment the services or functions to be performed will be carried out more effectively, more rapidly, or at less cost than if performed by the Department of Agriculture. Contracts under this section may be made for work to be performed within a period not more than four years from the date of any such contract, and advance, progress, or other payments may be made. The provisions of section 3324(a) and (b) of title 31 and section 6101 of title 41 shall not be applicable to contracts or agreements made under the authority of this section. Any unexpended balances of appropriations obligated by contracts as authorized by this section may, notwithstanding the provisions of section 5 of the Act of June 20, 1874, as amended (31 U.S.C., sec. 713), remain upon the books of the Treasury for not more than five fiscal years before being carried to the surplus fund and covered into the Treasury. Any contract made pursuant to this section shall contain requirements making the result of such research and investigations available to the public by such means as the Secretary of Agriculture shall determine.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Secretary of Agriculture shall promulgate such orders, rules, and regulations as he deems necessary to carry out the provisions of this chapter.</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(1) for an increasing number of people in the United States, these are times of great suffering and deprivation;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(2) rising unemployment, decreasing appropriations for social services, and increasingly adverse economic conditions have all contributed to produce hunger and want on a scale not experienced since the time of the Great Depression;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(3) the demand for every conceivable form of assistance for the hungry and needy people of the United States grows more critical daily, while the availability of goods and services to meet the needs of such people is rapidly diminishing;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(4) soup kitchens, food banks, and other organizations which provide food to the hungry report an astronomical increase in the number of persons seeking the assistance of such organizations;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(5) according to a study completed by the General Accounting Office [now Government Accountability Office] in 1977, one hundred and thirty-seven million tons of food, or more than 20 per centum of this country's total annual food production, is wasted or discarded in the United States each year;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(6) at wholesale and retail food distributors, shipping terminals, and other establishments all across the country, enormous quantities of fresh fruits and vegetables and dated dairy and bakery products are discarded each day, while growing numbers of Americans go to bed hungry and undernourished each night;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(7) in these times of budget constraints and appeals for reductions in Federal spending, the use of private resources to meet the basic food requirements of our citizens should be encouraged; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(8) many States and local governments have not enacted laws which limit the liability of food donors, such as so-called Good Samaritan Acts and donor liability laws, and thus have discouraged donation of food to the needy by private persons.</p>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(b) It is the sense of the Congress that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(1) departments and agencies of the Federal Government should take such steps as may be necessary to distribute to hungry people of the United States surplus food or food which would otherwise be discarded;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(2) State and local governments which have not yet enacted so-called Good Samaritan or donor liability laws to encourage private cooperative efforts to provide food for hungry people within their respective jurisdictions should do so as quickly as possible; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(3) wholesale and retail food distributors, shipping terminals, and other establishments should work more closely with religious, community, and other charitable organizations to make wholesome food which is currently being wasted or discarded by such establishments available for immediate distribution to hungry people of the United States.&quot;</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Codification</h4>
<p class="note-body">Provisions that authorized the Secretary of Agriculture to &quot;fix the compensation&quot; of any technically qualified person, firm, or organization by contract or otherwise on a temporary basis and for a term not to exceed six months in any fiscal year to perform research, inspection, classification, technical or other special services, without regard to the &quot;Classification Act of 1923, as amended&quot; were omitted as obsolete. Sections 1202 and 1204 of the Classification Act of 1949, 63 Stat. 972, 973 repealed the 1923 Act and all laws or parts of laws inconsistent with the 1949 Act. While section 1106(a) of the 1949 Act provided that references in other laws to the 1923 Act should be held and considered to mean the 1949 Act, it did not have the effect of continuing the exceptions contained in this subsection because of section 1106(b) which provided that the application of the 1949 Act to any position, officer, or employee shall not be affected by section 1106(a). The Classification Act of 1949 was repealed by Pub. L. 89&ndash;554, &sect;8(a), Sept. 6, 1966, 80 Stat. 632 (of which section 1 revised and enacted Title 5, U.S.C., into law). Section 5102 of Title 5, now contains the applicability provisions of the 1949 Act, and section 5103 of Title 5 authorizes the Office of Personnel Management to determine the applicability to specific positions and employees.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) certain State laws permit a secured lender to enforce liens against a purchaser of farm products even if the purchaser does not know that the sale of the products violates the lender's security interest in the products, lacks any practical method for discovering the existence of the security interest, and has no reasonable means to ensure that the seller uses the sales proceeds to repay the lender;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) these laws subject the purchaser of farm products to double payment for the products, once at the time of purchase, and again when the seller fails to repay the lender;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the exposure of purchasers of farm products to double payment inhibits free competition in the market for farm products; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) this exposure constitutes a burden on and an obstruction to interstate commerce in farm products.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Establishment of mandatory standard</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not later than 2 years after July 29, 2016, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) establish a national mandatory bioengineered food disclosure standard with respect to any bioengineered food and any food that may be bioengineered; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) establish such requirements and procedures as the Secretary determines necessary to carry out the standard.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Regulations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A food may bear a disclosure that the food is bioengineered only in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Secretary in accordance with this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A regulation promulgated by the Secretary in carrying out this subchapter shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) prohibit a food derived from an animal to be considered a bioengineered food solely because the animal consumed feed produced from, containing, or consisting of a bioengineered substance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) determine the amounts of a bioengineered substance that may be present in food, as appropriate, in order for the food to be a bioengineered food;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:947 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) establish a process for requesting and granting a determination by the Secretary regarding other factors and conditions under which a food is considered a bioengineered food;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) in accordance with subsection (d), require that the form of a food disclosure under this section be a text, symbol, or electronic or digital link, but excluding Internet website Uniform Resource Locators not embedded in the link, with the disclosure option to be selected by the food manufacturer;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) provide alternative reasonable disclosure options for food contained in small or very small packages;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) in the case of small food manufacturers, provide&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) an implementation date that is not earlier than 1 year after the implementation date for regulations promulgated in accordance with this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) on-package disclosure options, in addition to those available under subparagraph (D), to be selected by the small food manufacturer, that consist of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) a telephone number accompanied by appropriate language to indicate that the phone number provides access to additional information; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) exclude&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) food served in a restaurant or similar retail food establishment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) very small food manufacturers.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Safety</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The availability of wireless Internet or cellular networks.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The availability of landline telephones in stores.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Challenges facing small retailers and rural retailers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) The efforts that retailers and other entities have taken to address potential technology and infrastructure challenges.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) The costs and benefits of installing in retail stores electronic or digital link scanners or other evolving technology that provide bioengineering disclosure information.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Additional disclosure options</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary determines in the study conducted under paragraph (1) that consumers, while shopping, would not have sufficient access to the bioengineering disclosure through electronic or digital disclosure methods, the Secretary, after consultation with food retailers and manufacturers, shall provide additional and comparable options to access the bioengineering disclosure.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Disclosure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In promulgating regulations under this section, the Secretary shall ensure that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) on-package language accompanies&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the electronic or digital link will provide access to the bioengineering disclosure located, in a consistent and conspicuous manner, on the first product information page that appears for the product on a mobile device, Internet website, or other landing page, which shall exclude marketing and promotional information;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3)(A) the electronic or digital link disclosure may not collect, analyze, or sell any personally identifiable information about consumers or the devices of consumers; but</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if information described in subparagraph (A) must be collected to carry out the purposes of this subchapter, that information shall be deleted immediately and not used for any other purpose;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the electronic or digital link disclosure also includes a telephone number that provides access to the bioengineering disclosure; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the electronic or digital link disclosure is of sufficient size to be easily and effectively scanned or read by a digital device.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) State food labeling standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding section 1639i of this title, no State or political subdivision of a State may directly or indirectly establish under any authority or continue in effect as to any food in interstate commerce any requirement relating to the labeling or disclosure of whether a food is bioengineered or was developed or produced using <!-- PDFPage:948 -->bioengineering for a food that is the subject of the national bioengineered food disclosure standard under this section that is not identical to the mandatory disclosure requirement under that standard.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Consistency with certain laws</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall consider establishing consistency between&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the national bioengineered food disclosure standard established under this section; and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Enforcement</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Prohibited act</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">It shall be a prohibited act for a person to knowingly fail to make a disclosure as required under this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each person subject to the mandatory disclosure requirement under this section shall maintain, and make available to the Secretary, on request, such records as the Secretary determines to be customary or reasonable in the food industry, by regulation, to establish compliance with this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Examination and audit</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary may conduct an examination, audit, or similar activity with respect to any records required under paragraph (2).</p>
