<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Based on acts Mar. 3, 1899, ch. 419, &sect;31, 30 Stat. 1021; Mar. 6, 1902, ch. 139, &sect;6, 32 Stat. 52.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section is new to the United States Code, but is in accordance with current practice. Act Mar. 3, 1899, ch. 419, 30 Stat. 1014, which established the &quot;Census Office&quot; on a temporary basis, provided in section 31 thereof (30 Stat. 1021) for a seal for that office. The office was made permanent by act Mar. 6, 1902, ch. 139, 32 Stat. 51, and section 6 of that act (32 Stat. 52) continued in full force and effect &quot;for the taking of the Thirteenth and subsequent censuses&quot; all provisions of the act of Mar. 3, 1899, not inconsistent with the provisions of such 1902 act. Therefore, since the 1902 act contained no provisions with respect to a seal, section 31 of the 1899 act, providing for the seal, remained in force as it was not inconsistent. Section 33 of act July 2, 1909, ch. 2, 36 Stat. 10, which act (36 Stat. 1) related to the Thirteenth and subsequent decennial censuses, repealed the said act of Mar. 3, 1899, specifically, and all &quot;other&quot; laws and parts of laws inconsistent with the provisions of the 1909 act. These repealing provisions are somewhat ambiguous, but it was probably the intent of Congress, as it was the intent thereof at the time of enactment of the act of Mar. 6, 1902, referred to above, to continue in effect all provisions of the act of Mar. 3, 1899, that were not inconsistent with the act of July 2, 1909. The 1909 act contained no provisions with respect to the seal, and it accordingly follows that the provisions of section 31 of the act of Mar. 3, 1899, with respect thereto, continued in force. This is also the interpretation of the Bureau of the Census, which has continued to use a seal through the years in connection with &quot;certificates and attestations&quot;.</p>
<p class="note-body">In any event, this new section merely confirms past and present practice, and restores, if it does not preserve, statutory authority for possession and use of the seal which is a very necessary part of the operations of the Bureau. Further, the section should serve to forestall future differences of interpretation. In the past, some States have refused to recognize the seal of the Census Bureau on the ground that it was not authorized by law. In all probability, this position was taken, not as the result of a search of the Statutes at Large, which would have been a difficult project, but because provisions relating to the seal were not set out in the United States Code where they would have been readily accessible.</p>
<p class="note-body">The language of this section follows substantially the language of section 31 of the act of Mar. 3, 1899, referred to above, but has been reworded because of jurisdictional and other changes since that time. The &quot;Census Office&quot; was transferred from the Department of the Interior to the Department of Commerce and Labor by act Feb. 14, 1903, ch. 552, &sect;4, 32 Stat. 826. Act Mar. 4, 1913, ch. 141, &sect;1, 37 Stat. 736, changed the name of the latter to the Department of Commerce, and created, as a separate department, the Department of Labor. It transferred a number of bureaus and agencies from the Department of Commerce to the Department of Labor, but these transfers did not affect the Bureau of the Census, which has remained under the jurisdiction of the Department of Commerce. 1950 Reorganization Plan No. 5, &sect;&sect;1, 2, eff. May 24, 1950, 15 F.R. 3174, 64 Stat. 1263, transferred all functions of all officers, employees, bureaus, and agencies of the Department of Commerce to the Secretary of Commerce, and vested power in him to delegate them or any of his other functions to any of such officers, employees, bureaus, and agencies. Therefore, in this section, &quot;Secretary&quot;, and &quot;Secretary or such officer or employee of the Bureau as he designates&quot;, were substituted, respectively, for two references to the Director of the Census, to conform with such Plan.</p>

<p class="note-body">Section is new, and was inserted to conform with 1950 Reorganization Plan No. 5, effective May 24, 1950, &sect;&sect;1, 2, 15 F.R. 3174, 64 Stat. 1263, which is set out as a note under section 591 of title 5, U. S. C., 1952 ed., Executive Departments and Government Officers and Employees [now set out in the Appendix to Title 5, Government Organization and Employees]. That plan transferred all functions (with a few exceptions not applicable to the Census Bureau) of all agencies, officers and employees of the Department of Commerce to the Secretary of Commerce, and vested power in him to delegate the functions so transferred, or any of his other functions, to such agencies, officers or employees within the Department as he designates.</p>
<p class="note-body">See, also, section 253 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., which provided for delegation of functions in connection with the quinquennial censuses of governments, and authorized the Secretary to promulgate rules and regulations with respect to such censuses. That section has been omitted from this revised title, as the provision thereof for delegation of functions is covered by this section, and the provision thereof which related to rules and regulations is covered by section 22 of title 1, U.S.C., 1952 ed., General Provisions.</p>
<p class="note-body">Because of the transfer effected by 1950 Reorganization Plan No. 5, referred to above, sections of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., which prescribed functions of the Bureau of the Census, the Census Office, or the Director of the Census, have, in this revised title, been changed to refer to the Secretary.</p>

<p class="note-body">Section consolidates parts of sections 203 and 216 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., with that part of subsection (b) of section 1442 of title 42, U.S.C., 1952 ed., which made such sections 203 and 216 applicable to the censuses of housing.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 122 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., which related to quinquennial censuses of manufacturers, the mineral industries, transportation, and other businesses (see subchapter I of chapter 5 of this revised title), and section 252 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., which related to quinquennial censuses of governments (see subchapter III of chapter 5 of this title), made section 203 of such title applicable to those censuses. However, since the particular provisions of such section 203 that have been carried into this revised section apparently related, as supplemented by section 1442(b) of title 42, U.S.C., 1952 ed., to the decennial censuses provided for in sections 201 et seq. of such title, and in such section 1442 of title 42 (see subchapter II of chapter 5 of this revised title), and apparently could have no relevancy to the quinquennial censuses referred to above, this revised section relates only to such decennial censuses.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), &quot;Departmental Service&quot; was substituted for &quot;District of Columbia&quot;, since the Bureau of the Census now has its headquarters in Maryland, and not in the District of Columbia.</p>
<p class="note-body">In this section, a reference to the Bureau of the Census was changed to a reference to the Department of Commerce, and references to the Director of the Census were changed in all but one case to references to the Secretary (of Commerce) to conform with 1950 Reorganization Plan No. 5, &sect;&sect;1, 2, eff. May 24, 1950, 15 F.R. 3174, 64 Stat. 1263. See Revision Note to section 4 of this title. The provision of section 203 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., that appointments under the particular provisions thereof that have been carried into subsection (a) of this revised section should be made upon the recommendation of the Director of the Census, have been omitted from such subsection (a) for the same reason. Further, words &quot;or to whatever other officer is designated by the Secretary to take the census provided for in sections 141 and 142 of this title&quot; were inserted after &quot;Director of the Census&quot; in par. (1) of subsection (a), to conform with such 1950 Reorganization Plan.</p>
<p class="note-body">The first paragraph of section 203 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., which provided for the employment of two assistant directors for each decennial census period, was omitted as obsolete and superseded, in view of section 122 of such title, which made such section 203 applicable to the quinquennial censuses of manufactures and other businesses, and to surveys (see subchapter IV of chapter 5 of this title), thus rendering such first paragraph ineffective and meaningless. See also section 121(b) of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed.</p>
<p class="note-body">The third proviso in the second paragraph of section 203 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., giving preference in appointments to disabled war veterans, their widows, and, under certain circumstances, to their wives, was omitted as superseded and covered by the Veterans&apos; Preference Act of 1944 (chapter 17 of title 5, U.S.C., 1952 ed., Executive Departments and Government Officers and Employees).</p>
<p class="note-body">Changes were made in phraseology and arrangement.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Secretary may utilize the services of nontemporary employees of the Bureau (by assignment, promotion, appointment, detail, or otherwise) in temporary positions established for any census, for not to exceed the period during which appropriations are available for that census. Whenever the Secretary determines that the services of an employee which have been utilized under this section are no longer required in such a temporary position, he may, without regard to the provisions of any other law, return the employee to a continuing position, with rank and compensation not less than that which he held in his last permanent position in the Bureau: <i>Provided</i>, That no employee shall, by reason of his service in a temporary position under this subsection, lose the protection of any law or regulation with respect to his separation, suspension, furlough, or reduction in rank or compensation below the level held in his last permanent position in the Bureau. Service by a nontemporary employee in a temporary position under this subsection shall be creditable for step-increases (both periodic and longevity) under title VII of the Classification Act of 1949, as amended, as though it were a continuation of service in his last permanent position.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) As used in this title with respect to appointments or positions, &quot;temporary&quot; shall be construed to mean not in excess of one year, or not in excess of the specific period during which appropriations are available for the conduct of a particular census, whichever is longer. No employee of the Bureau who holds only a temporary appointment within the meaning of this section shall be considered as other than strictly temporary for purposes of any other provision of law relating to separations, suspensions, or reductions in rank or compensation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The enlisted men and officers of the uniformed services may be appointed and compensated for service in temporary enumerator positions for the enumeration of personnel of the uniformed services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The Secretary may fix compensation on a piece-price basis without limitation as to the amount earned per diem, and payments may be made to enumerators for the use of private automobiles on official business without regard to section 4 of the Travel Expense Act of 1949, as amended (5 U.S.C. 837), but at rates not in excess of the rates provided by that Act.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) The Secretary may authorize the expenditure of necessary sums for travel expenses of persons selected for appointment for attendance at training courses held by the Department of Commerce with respect to any of the work provided for by law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of law prohibiting the expenditure of public money for telephone service, the Secretary, under such regulations as he shall prescribe, may authorize reimbursement for tolls or charges for telephone service from private residences or private apartments to the extent such charges are determined by the Secretary to have been incurred to facilitate the collection of information in connection with the censuses and surveys authorized by this title.</p>

<p class="note-body">The provisions have been reworded to make it clear that they relate to all collections of statistics, censuses, etc., provided for in this title.</p>

<p class="note-body">The provision of section 203 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., that the Director of the Census might delegate to the supervisors the authority to appoint enumerators, was omitted because all functions of the Director and other officers and employees of the Department of Commerce and its bureaus and agencies were transferred to the Secretary by 1950 Reorganization Plan No. 5, referred to above. However, section 4 of this title provides for delegation of functions by the Secretary.</p>
